<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>The pedigrees of our county families, arranged in diagrams on 
the pages of county histories, mostly appear at first sight to be
as barren of any touch of nature as a table of logarithms.&nbsp; 
But given a clue&mdash;the faintest tradition of what went on 
behind the scenes, and this dryness as of dust may be transformed
into a palpitating drama.&nbsp; More, the careful comparison of 
dates alone&mdash;that of birth with marriage, of marriage with 
death, of one marriage, birth, or death with a kindred marriage, 
birth, or death&mdash;will often effect the same transformation, 
and anybody practised in raising images from such genealogies 
finds himself unconsciously filling into the framework the 
motives, passions, and personal qualities which would appear to 
be the single explanation possible of some extraordinary 
conjunction in times, events, and personages that occasionally 
marks these reticent family records.</p>
<p>Out of such pedigrees and supplementary material most of the 
following stories have arisen and taken shape.</p>
<p>I would make this preface an opportunity of expressing my 
sense of the courtesy and kindness of several bright-eyed Noble 
Dames yet in the flesh, who, since the first publication of these
tales in periodicals, six or seven years ago, have given me 
interesting comments and conjectures on such of the narratives as
they have recognized to be connected with their own families, 
residences, or traditions; in which they have shown a truly 
philosophic absence of prejudice in their regard of those 
incidents whose relation has tended more distinctly to dramatize 
than to eulogize their ancestors.&nbsp; The outlines they have 
also given of other singular events in their family histories for
use in a second &ldquo;Group of Noble Dames,&rdquo; will, I fear,
never reach the printing-press through me; but I shall store them
up in memory of my informants&rsquo; good nature.</p>

<h2>DAME THE FIRST&mdash;THE FIRST COUNTESS OF WESSEX<br />
By the Local Historian</h2>
<p>King&rsquo;s-Hintock Court (said the narrator, turning over 
his memoranda for reference)&mdash;King&rsquo;s-Hintock Court is,
as we know, one of the most imposing of the mansions that 
overlook our beautiful Blackmoor or Blakemore Vale.&nbsp; On the 
particular occasion of which I have to speak this building stood,
as it had often stood before, in the perfect silence of a calm 
clear night, lighted only by the cold shine of the stars.&nbsp; 
The season was winter, in days long ago, the last century having 
run but little more than a third of its length.&nbsp; North, 
south, and west, not a casement was unfastened, not a curtain 
undrawn; eastward, one window on the upper floor was open, and a 
girl of twelve or thirteen was leaning over the sill.&nbsp; That 
she had not taken up the position for purposes of observation was
apparent at a glance, for she kept her eyes covered with her 
hands.</p>
<p>The room occupied by the girl was an inner one of a suite, to 
be reached only by passing through a large bedchamber 
adjoining.&nbsp; From this apartment voices in altercation were 
audible, everything else in the building being so still.&nbsp; It
was to avoid listening to these voices that the girl had left her
little cot, thrown a cloak round her head and shoulders, and 
stretched into the night air.</p>
<p>But she could not escape the conversation, try as she 
would.&nbsp; The words reached her in all their painfulness, one 
sentence in masculine tones, those of her father, being repeated 
many times.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell &rsquo;ee there shall be no such 
betrothal!&nbsp; I tell &rsquo;ee there 
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t!&nbsp; A child like her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She knew the subject of dispute to be herself.&nbsp; A cool 
feminine voice, her mother&rsquo;s, replied:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have done with you, and be wise.&nbsp; He is willing to
wait a good five or six years before the marriage takes place, 
and there&rsquo;s not a man in the county to compare with 
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It shall not be!&nbsp; He is over thirty.&nbsp; It is 
wickedness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is just thirty, and the best and finest man 
alive&mdash;a perfect match for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is poor!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But his father and elder brothers are made much of at 
Court&mdash;none so constantly at the palace as they; and with 
her fortune, who knows?&nbsp; He may be able to get a 
barony.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe you are in love with en yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you insult me so, Thomas!&nbsp; And is it not 
monstrous for you to talk of my wickedness when you have a like 
scheme in your own head?&nbsp; You know you have.&nbsp; Some 
bumpkin of your own choosing&mdash;some petty gentleman who lives
down at that outlandish place of yours, Falls-Park&mdash;one of 
your pot-companions&rsquo; sons&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was an outburst of imprecation on the part of her 
husband in lieu of further argument.&nbsp; As soon as he could 
utter a connected sentence he said: &lsquo;You crow and you 
domineer, mistress, because you are heiress-general here.&nbsp; 
You are in your own house; you are on your own land.&nbsp; But 
let me tell &rsquo;ee that if I did come here to you instead of 
taking you to me, it was done at the dictates of convenience 
merely.&nbsp; H---!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m no beggar!&nbsp; 
Ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I a place of my own?&nbsp; Ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t 
I an avenue as long as thine?&nbsp; Ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I beeches 
that will more than match thy oaks?&nbsp; I should have lived in 
my own quiet house and land, contented, if you had not called me 
off with your airs and graces.&nbsp; Faith, I&rsquo;ll go back 
there; I&rsquo;ll not stay with thee longer!&nbsp; If it had not 
been for our Betty I should have gone long ago!&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this there were no more words; but presently, hearing 
the sound of a door opening and shutting below, the girl again 
looked from the window.&nbsp; Footsteps crunched on the 
gravel-walk, and a shape in a drab greatcoat, easily 
distinguishable as her father, withdrew from the house.&nbsp; He 
moved to the left, and she watched him diminish down the long 
east front till he had turned the corner and vanished.&nbsp; He 
must have gone round to the stables.</p>
<p>She closed the window and shrank into bed, where she cried 
herself to sleep.&nbsp; This child, their only one, Betty, 
beloved ambitiously by her mother, and with uncalculating 
passionateness by her father, was frequently made wretched by 
such episodes as this; though she was too young to care very 
deeply, for her own sake, whether her mother betrothed her to the
gentleman discussed or not.</p>
<p>The Squire had often gone out of the house in this manner, 
declaring that he would never return, but he had always 
reappeared in the morning.&nbsp; The present occasion, however, 
was different in the issue: next day she was told that her father
had ridden to his estate at Falls-Park early in the morning on 
business with his agent, and might not come back for some 
days.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Falls-Park was over twenty miles from King&rsquo;s-Hintock 
Court, and was altogether a more modest centre-piece to a more 
modest possession than the latter.&nbsp; But as Squire Dornell 
came in view of it that February morning, he thought that he had 
been a fool ever to leave it, though it was for the sake of the 
greatest heiress in Wessex.&nbsp; Its classic front, of the 
period of the second Charles, derived from its regular features a
dignity which the great, battlemented, heterogeneous mansion of 
his wife could not eclipse.&nbsp; Altogether he was sick at 
heart, and the gloom which the densely-timbered park threw over 
the scene did not tend to remove the depression of this rubicund 
man of eight-and-forty, who sat so heavily upon his 
gelding.&nbsp; The child, his darling Betty: there lay the root 
of his trouble.&nbsp; He was unhappy when near his wife, he was 
unhappy when away from his little girl; and from this dilemma 
there was no practicable escape.&nbsp; As a consequence he 
indulged rather freely in the pleasures of the table, became what
was called a three bottle man, and, in his wife&rsquo;s 
estimation, less and less presentable to her polite friends from 
town.</p>
<p>He was received by the two or three old servants who were in 
charge of the lonely place, where a few rooms only were kept 
habitable for his use or that of his friends when hunting; and 
during the morning he was made more comfortable by the arrival of
his faithful servant Tupcombe from King&rsquo;s-Hintock.&nbsp; 
But after a day or two spent here in solitude he began to feel 
that he had made a mistake in coming.&nbsp; By leaving 
King&rsquo;s-Hintock in his anger he had thrown away his best 
opportunity of counteracting his wife&rsquo;s preposterous notion
of promising his poor little Betty&rsquo;s hand to a man she had 
hardly seen.&nbsp; To protect her from such a repugnant bargain 
he should have remained on the spot.&nbsp; He felt it almost as a
misfortune that the child would inherit so much wealth.&nbsp; She
would be a mark for all the adventurers in the kingdom.&nbsp; Had
she been only the heiress to his own unassuming little place at 
Falls, how much better would have been her chances of 
happiness!</p>
<p>His wife had divined truly when she insinuated that he himself
had a lover in view for this pet child.&nbsp; The son of a dear 
deceased friend of his, who lived not two miles from where the 
Squire now was, a lad a couple of years his daughter&rsquo;s 
senior, seemed in her father&rsquo;s opinion the one person in 
the world likely to make her happy.&nbsp; But as to breathing 
such a scheme to either of the young people with the indecent 
haste that his wife had shown, he would not dream of it; years 
hence would be soon enough for that.&nbsp; They had already seen 
each other, and the Squire fancied that he noticed a tenderness 
on the youth&rsquo;s part which promised well.&nbsp; He was 
strongly tempted to profit by his wife&rsquo;s example, and 
forestall her match-making by throwing the two young people 
together there at Falls.&nbsp; The girl, though marriageable in 
the views of those days, was too young to be in love, but the lad
was fifteen, and already felt an interest in her.</p>
<p>Still better than keeping watch over her at King&rsquo;s 
Hintock, where she was necessarily much under her mother&rsquo;s 
influence, would it be to get the child to stay with him at Falls
for a time, under his exclusive control.&nbsp; But how accomplish
this without using main force?&nbsp; The only possible chance was
that his wife might, for appearance&rsquo; sake, as she had done 
before, consent to Betty paying him a day&rsquo;s visit, when he 
might find means of detaining her till Reynard, the suitor whom 
his wife favoured, had gone abroad, which he was expected to do 
the following week.&nbsp; Squire Dornell determined to return to 
King&rsquo;s-Hintock and attempt the enterprise.&nbsp; If he were
refused, it was almost in him to pick up Betty bodily and carry 
her off.</p>
<p>The journey back, vague and Quixotic as were his intentions, 
was performed with a far lighter heart than his setting 
forth.&nbsp; He would see Betty, and talk to her, come what might
of his plan.</p>
<p>So he rode along the dead level which stretches between the 
hills skirting Falls-Park and those bounding the town of Ivell, 
trotted through that borough, and out by the King&rsquo;s-Hintock
highway, till, passing the villages he entered the mile-long 
drive through the park to the Court.&nbsp; The drive being open, 
without an avenue, the Squire could discern the north front and 
door of the Court a long way off, and was himself visible from 
the windows on that side; for which reason he hoped that Betty 
might perceive him coming, as she sometimes did on his return 
from an outing, and run to the door or wave her handkerchief.</p>
<p>But there was no sign.&nbsp; He inquired for his wife as soon 
as he set foot to earth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mistress is away.&nbsp; She was called to London, 
sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Mistress Betty?&rsquo; said the Squire blankly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone likewise, sir, for a little change.&nbsp; Mistress
has left a letter for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The note explained nothing, merely stating that she had posted
to London on her own affairs, and had taken the child to give her
a holiday.&nbsp; On the fly-leaf were some words from Betty 
herself to the same effect, evidently written in a state of high 
jubilation at the idea of her jaunt.&nbsp; Squire Dornell 
murmured a few expletives, and submitted to his 
disappointment.&nbsp; How long his wife meant to stay in town she
did not say; but on investigation he found that the carriage had 
been packed with sufficient luggage for a sojourn of two or three
weeks.</p>
<p>King&rsquo;s-Hintock Court was in consequence as gloomy as 
Falls-Park had been.&nbsp; He had lost all zest for hunting of 
late, and had hardly attended a meet that season.&nbsp; Dornell 
read and re-read Betty&rsquo;s scrawl, and hunted up some other 
such notes of hers to look over, this seeming to be the only 
pleasure there was left for him.&nbsp; That they were really in 
London he learnt in a few days by another letter from Mrs. 
Dornell, in which she explained that they hoped to be home in 
about a week, and that she had had no idea he was coming back to 
King&rsquo;s-Hintock so soon, or she would not have gone away 
without telling him.</p>
<p>Squire Dornell wondered if, in going or returning, it had been
her plan to call at the Reynards&rsquo; place near Melchester, 
through which city their journey lay.&nbsp; It was possible that 
she might do this in furtherance of her project, and the sense 
that his own might become the losing game was harassing.</p>
<p>He did not know how to dispose of himself, till it occurred to
him that, to get rid of his intolerable heaviness, he would 
invite some friends to dinner and drown his cares in grog and 
wine.&nbsp; No sooner was the carouse decided upon than he put it
in hand; those invited being mostly neighbouring landholders, all
smaller men than himself, members of the hunt; also the doctor 
from Evershead, and the like&mdash;some of them rollicking blades
whose presence his wife would not have countenanced had she been 
at home.&nbsp; &lsquo;When the cat&rsquo;s away&mdash;!&rsquo; 
said the Squire.</p>
<p>They arrived, and there were indications in their manner that 
they meant to make a night of it.&nbsp; Baxby of Sherton Castle 
was late, and they waited a quarter of an hour for him, he being 
one of the liveliest of Dornell&rsquo;s friends; without whose 
presence no such dinner as this would be considered complete, 
and, it may be added, with whose presence no dinner which 
included both sexes could be conducted with strict 
propriety.&nbsp; He had just returned from London, and the Squire
was anxious to talk to him&mdash;for no definite reason; but he 
had lately breathed the atmosphere in which Betty was.</p>
<p>At length they heard Baxby driving up to the door, whereupon 
the host and the rest of his guests crossed over to the 
dining-room.&nbsp; In a moment Baxby came hastily in at their 
heels, apologizing for his lateness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only came back last night, you know,&rsquo; he said; 
&lsquo;and the truth o&rsquo;t is, I had as much as I could 
carry.&rsquo;&nbsp; He turned to the Squire.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, 
Dornell&mdash;so cunning Reynard has stolen your little ewe 
lamb?&nbsp; Ha, ha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; said Squire Dornell vacantly, across the 
dining-table, round which they were all standing, the cold March 
sunlight streaming in upon his full-clean shaven face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely th&rsquo;st know what all the town 
knows?&mdash;you&rsquo;ve had a letter by this time?&mdash;that 
Stephen Reynard has married your Betty?&nbsp; Yes, as I&rsquo;m a
living man.&nbsp; It was a carefully-arranged thing: they parted 
at once, and are not to meet for five or six years.&nbsp; But, 
Lord, you must know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A thud on the floor was the only reply of the Squire.&nbsp; 
They quickly turned.&nbsp; He had fallen down like a log behind 
the table, and lay motionless on the oak boards.</p>
<p>Those at hand hastily bent over him, and the whole group were 
in confusion.&nbsp; They found him to be quite unconscious, 
though puffing and panting like a blacksmith&rsquo;s 
bellows.&nbsp; His face was livid, his veins swollen, and beads 
of perspiration stood upon his brow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s happened to him?&rsquo; said several.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An apoplectic fit,&rsquo; said the doctor from 
Evershead, gravely.</p>
<p>He was only called in at the Court for small ailments, as a 
rule, and felt the importance of the situation.&nbsp; He lifted 
the Squire&rsquo;s head, loosened his cravat and clothing, and 
rang for the servants, who took the Squire upstairs.</p>
<p>There he lay as if in a drugged sleep.&nbsp; The surgeon drew 
a basin-full of blood from him, but it was nearly six 
o&rsquo;clock before he came to himself.&nbsp; The dinner was 
completely disorganized, and some had gone home long ago; but two
or three remained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless my soul,&rsquo; Baxby kept repeating, &lsquo;I 
didn&rsquo;t know things had come to this pass between Dornell 
and his lady!&nbsp; I thought the feast he was spreading to-day 
was in honour of the event, though privately kept for the 
present!&nbsp; His little maid married without his 
knowledge!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the Squire recovered consciousness he gasped: 
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis abduction!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a capital 
felony!&nbsp; He can be hung!&nbsp; Where is Baxby?&nbsp; I am 
very well now.&nbsp; What items have ye heard, Baxby?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The bearer of the untoward news was extremely unwilling to 
agitate Dornell further, and would say little more at 
first.&nbsp; But an hour after, when the Squire had partially 
recovered and was sitting up, Baxby told as much as he knew, the 
most important particular being that Betty&rsquo;s mother was 
present at the marriage, and showed every mark of approval.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Everything appeared to have been done so regularly that I,
of course, thought you knew all about it,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew no more than the underground dead that such a 
step was in the wind!&nbsp; A child not yet thirteen!&nbsp; How 
Sue hath outwitted me!&nbsp; Did Reynard go up to Lon&rsquo;on 
with &rsquo;em, d&rsquo;ye know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say.&nbsp; All I know is that your lady 
and daughter were walking along the street, with the footman 
behind &rsquo;em; that they entered a jeweller&rsquo;s shop, 
where Reynard was standing; and that there, in the presence 
o&rsquo; the shopkeeper and your man, who was called in on 
purpose, your Betty said to Reynard&mdash;so the story goes: 
&rsquo;pon my soul I don&rsquo;t vouch for the truth of 
it&mdash;she said, &ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I 
want to marry you: will you have me&mdash;now or never?&rdquo; 
she said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What she said means nothing,&rsquo; murmured the 
Squire, with wet eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Her mother put the words into
her mouth to avoid the serious consequences that would attach to 
any suspicion of force.&nbsp; The words be not the child&rsquo;s:
she didn&rsquo;t dream of marriage&mdash;how should she, poor 
little maid!&nbsp; Go on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, be that as it will, they were all agreed 
apparently.&nbsp; They bought the ring on the spot, and the 
marriage took place at the nearest church within 
half-an-hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>A day or two later there came a letter from Mrs. Dornell to 
her husband, written before she knew of his stroke.&nbsp; She 
related the circumstances of the marriage in the gentlest manner,
and gave cogent reasons and excuses for consenting to the 
premature union, which was now an accomplished fact indeed.&nbsp;
She had no idea, till sudden pressure was put upon her, that the 
contract was expected to be carried out so soon, but being taken 
half unawares, she had consented, having learned that Stephen 
Reynard, now their son-in-law, was becoming a great favourite at 
Court, and that he would in all likelihood have a title granted 
him before long.&nbsp; No harm could come to their dear daughter 
by this early marriage-contract, seeing that her life would be 
continued under their own eyes, exactly as before, for some 
years.&nbsp; In fine, she had felt that no other such fair 
opportunity for a good marriage with a shrewd courtier and wise 
man of the world, who was at the same time noted for his 
excellent personal qualities, was within the range of 
probability, owing to the rusticated lives they led at 
King&rsquo;s-Hintock.&nbsp; Hence she had yielded to 
Stephen&rsquo;s solicitation, and hoped her husband would forgive
her.&nbsp; She wrote, in short, like a woman who, having had her 
way as to the deed, is prepared to make any concession as to 
words and subsequent behaviour.</p>
<p>All this Dornell took at its true value, or rather, perhaps, 
at less than its true value.&nbsp; As his life depended upon his 
not getting into a passion, he controlled his perturbed emotions 
as well as he was able, going about the house sadly and utterly 
unlike his former self.&nbsp; He took every precaution to prevent
his wife knowing of the incidents of his sudden illness, from a 
sense of shame at having a heart so tender; a ridiculous quality,
no doubt, in her eyes, now that she had become so imbued with 
town ideas.&nbsp; But rumours of his seizure somehow reached her,
and she let him know that she was about to return to nurse 
him.&nbsp; He thereupon packed up and went off to his own place 
at Falls-Park.</p>
<p>Here he lived the life of a recluse for some time.&nbsp; He 
was still too unwell to entertain company, or to ride to hounds 
or elsewhither; but more than this, his aversion to the faces of 
strangers and acquaintances, who knew by that time of the trick 
his wife had played him, operated to hold him aloof.</p>
<p>Nothing could influence him to censure Betty for her share in 
the exploit.&nbsp; He never once believed that she had acted 
voluntarily.&nbsp; Anxious to know how she was getting on, he 
despatched the trusty servant Tupcombe to Evershead village, 
close to King&rsquo;s-Hintock, timing his journey so that he 
should reach the place under cover of dark.&nbsp; The emissary 
arrived without notice, being out of livery, and took a seat in 
the chimney-corner of the Sow-and-Acorn.</p>
<p>The conversation of the droppers-in was always of the nine 
days&rsquo; wonder&mdash;the recent marriage.&nbsp; The smoking 
listener learnt that Mrs. Dornell and the girl had returned to 
King&rsquo;s-Hintock for a day or two, that Reynard had set out 
for the Continent, and that Betty had since been packed off to 
school.&nbsp; She did not realize her position as Reynard&rsquo;s
child-wife&mdash;so the story went&mdash;and though somewhat 
awe-stricken at first by the ceremony, she had soon recovered her
spirits on finding that her freedom was in no way to be 
interfered with.</p>
<p>After that, formal messages began to pass between Dornell and 
his wife, the latter being now as persistently conciliating as 
she was formerly masterful.&nbsp; But her rustic, simple, 
blustering husband still held personally aloof.&nbsp; Her wish to
be reconciled&mdash;to win his forgiveness for her 
stratagem&mdash;moreover, a genuine tenderness and desire to 
soothe his sorrow, which welled up in her at times, brought her 
at last to his door at Falls-Park one day.</p>
<p>They had not met since that night of altercation, before her 
departure for London and his subsequent illness.&nbsp; She was 
shocked at the change in him.&nbsp; His face had become 
expressionless, as blank as that of a puppet, and what troubled 
her still more was that she found him living in one room, and 
indulging freely in stimulants, in absolute disobedience to the 
physician&rsquo;s order.&nbsp; The fact was obvious that he could
no longer be allowed to live thus uncouthly.</p>
<p>So she sympathized, and begged his pardon, and coaxed.&nbsp; 
But though after this date there was no longer such a complete 
estrangement as before, they only occasionally saw each other, 
Dornell for the most part making Falls his headquarters 
still.</p>
<p>Three or four years passed thus.&nbsp; Then she came one day, 
with more animation in her manner, and at once moved him by the 
simple statement that Betty&rsquo;s schooling had ended; she had 
returned, and was grieved because he was away.&nbsp; She had sent
a message to him in these words: &lsquo;Ask father to come home 
to his dear Betty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; Then she is very unhappy!&rsquo; said Squire 
Dornell.</p>
<p>His wife was silent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis that accursed marriage!&rsquo; continued the
Squire.</p>
<p>Still his wife would not dispute with him.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is
outside in the carriage,&rsquo; said Mrs. Dornell gently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;Betty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rsquo;&nbsp; Dornell 
rushed out, and there was the girl awaiting his forgiveness, for 
she supposed herself, no less than her mother, to be under his 
displeasure.</p>
<p>Yes, Betty had left school, and had returned to 
King&rsquo;s-Hintock.&nbsp; She was nearly seventeen, and had 
developed to quite a young woman.&nbsp; She looked not less a 
member of the household for her early marriage-contract, which 
she seemed, indeed, to have almost forgotten.&nbsp; It was like a
dream to her; that clear cold March day, the London church, with 
its gorgeous pews, and green-baize linings, and the great organ 
in the west gallery&mdash;so different from their own little 
church in the shrubbery of King&rsquo;s-Hintock Court&mdash;the 
man of thirty, to whose face she had looked up with so much awe, 
and with a sense that he was rather ugly and formidable; the man 
whom, though they corresponded politely, she had never seen 
since; one to whose existence she was now so indifferent that if 
informed of his death, and that she would never see him more, she
would merely have replied, &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Betty&rsquo;s passions as yet still slept.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hast heard from thy husband lately?&rsquo; said Squire 
Dornell, when they were indoors, with an ironical laugh of 
fondness which demanded no answer.</p>
<p>The girl winced, and he noticed that his wife looked 
appealingly at him.&nbsp; As the conversation went on, and there 
were signs that Dornell would express sentiments that might do 
harm to a position which they could not alter, Mrs. Dornell 
suggested that Betty should leave the room till her father and 
herself had finished their private conversation; and this Betty 
obediently did.</p>
<p>Dornell renewed his animadversions freely.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did 
you see how the sound of his name frightened her?&rsquo; he 
presently added.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you didn&rsquo;t, I did.&nbsp; 
Zounds! what a future is in store for that poor little 
unfortunate wench o&rsquo; mine!&nbsp; I tell &rsquo;ee, Sue, 
&rsquo;twas not a marriage at all, in morality, and if I were a 
woman in such a position, I shouldn&rsquo;t feel it as one.&nbsp;
She might, without a sign of sin, love a man of her choice as 
well now as if she were chained up to no other at all.&nbsp; 
There, that&rsquo;s my mind, and I can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; Ah,
Sue, my man was best!&nbsp; He&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; suited 
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rsquo; she replied 
incredulously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should see him; then you would.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s 
growing up a fine fellow, I can tell &rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush! not so loud!&rsquo; she answered, rising from her
seat and going to the door of the next room, whither her daughter
had betaken herself.&nbsp; To Mrs. Dornell&rsquo;s alarm, there 
sat Betty in a reverie, her round eyes fixed on vacancy, musing 
so deeply that she did not perceive her mother&rsquo;s 
entrance.&nbsp; She had heard every word, and was digesting the 
new knowledge.</p>
<p>Her mother felt that Falls-Park was dangerous ground for a 
young girl of the susceptible age, and in Betty&rsquo;s peculiar 
position, while Dornell talked and reasoned thus.&nbsp; She 
called Betty to her, and they took leave.&nbsp; The Squire would 
not clearly promise to return and make King&rsquo;s-Hintock Court
his permanent abode; but Betty&rsquo;s presence there, as at 
former times, was sufficient to make him agree to pay them a 
visit soon.</p>
<p>All the way home Betty remained preoccupied and silent.&nbsp; 
It was too plain to her anxious mother that Squire 
Dornell&rsquo;s free views had been a sort of awakening to the 
girl.</p>
<p>The interval before Dornell redeemed his pledge to come and 
see them was unexpectedly short.&nbsp; He arrived one morning 
about twelve o&rsquo;clock, driving his own pair of black-bays in
the curricle-phaeton with yellow panels and red wheels, just as 
he had used to do, and his faithful old Tupcombe on horseback 
behind.&nbsp; A young man sat beside the Squire in the carriage, 
and Mrs. Dornell&rsquo;s consternation could scarcely be 
concealed when, abruptly entering with his companion, the Squire 
announced him as his friend Phelipson of Elm-Cranlynch.</p>
<p>Dornell passed on to Betty in the background and tenderly 
kissed her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sting your mother&rsquo;s conscience, my
maid!&rsquo; he whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sting her conscience by 
pretending you are struck with Phelipson, and would ha&rsquo; 
loved him, as your old father&rsquo;s choice, much more than him 
she has forced upon &rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The simple-souled speaker fondly imagined that it as entirely 
in obedience to this direction that Betty&rsquo;s eyes stole 
interested glances at the frank and impulsive Phelipson that day 
at dinner, and he laughed grimly within himself to see how this 
joke of his, as he imagined it to be, was disturbing the peace of
mind of the lady of the house.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now Sue sees what a 
mistake she has made!&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dornell was verily greatly alarmed, and as soon as she 
could speak a word with him alone she upbraided him.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You ought not to have brought him here.&nbsp; Oh Thomas, 
how could you be so thoughtless!&nbsp; Lord, don&rsquo;t you see,
dear, that what is done cannot be undone, and how all this 
foolery jeopardizes her happiness with her husband?&nbsp; Until 
you interfered, and spoke in her hearing about this Phelipson, 
she was as patient and as willing as a lamb, and looked forward 
to Mr. Reynard&rsquo;s return with real pleasure.&nbsp; Since her
visit to Falls-Park she has been monstrous close-mouthed and busy
with her own thoughts.&nbsp; What mischief will you do?&nbsp; How
will it end?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Own, then, that my man was best suited to her.&nbsp; I 
only brought him to convince you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes; I do admit it.&nbsp; But oh! do take him back
again at once!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t keep him here!&nbsp; I fear she 
is even attracted by him already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, Sue.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis only a little trick to 
tease &rsquo;ee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless her motherly eye was not so likely to be deceived
as his, and if Betty were really only playing at being 
love-struck that day, she played at it with the perfection of a 
Rosalind, and would have deceived the best professors into a 
belief that it was no counterfeit.&nbsp; The Squire, having 
obtained his victory, was quite ready to take back the too 
attractive youth, and early in the afternoon they set out on 
their return journey.</p>
<p>A silent figure who rode behind them was as interested as 
Dornell in that day&rsquo;s experiment.&nbsp; It was the staunch 
Tupcombe, who, with his eyes on the Squire&rsquo;s and young 
Phelipson&rsquo;s backs, thought how well the latter would have 
suited Betty, and how greatly the former had changed for the 
worse during these last two or three years.&nbsp; He cursed his 
mistress as the cause of the change.</p>
<p>After this memorable visit to prove his point, the lives of 
the Dornell couple flowed on quietly enough for the space of a 
twelvemonth, the Squire for the most part remaining at Falls, and
Betty passing and repassing between them now and then, once or 
twice alarming her mother by not driving home from her 
father&rsquo;s house till midnight.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The repose of King&rsquo;s-Hintock was broken by the arrival 
of a special messenger.&nbsp; Squire Dornell had had an access of
gout so violent as to be serious.&nbsp; He wished to see Betty 
again: why had she not come for so long?</p>
<p>Mrs. Dornell was extremely reluctant to take Betty in that 
direction too frequently; but the girl was so anxious to go, her 
interests latterly seeming to be so entirely bound up in 
Falls-Park and its neighbourhood, that there was nothing to be 
done but to let her set out and accompany her.</p>
<p>Squire Dornell had been impatiently awaiting her 
arrival.&nbsp; They found him very ill and irritable.&nbsp; It 
had been his habit to take powerful medicines to drive away his 
enemy, and they had failed in their effect on this occasion.</p>
<p>The presence of his daughter, as usual, calmed him much, even 
while, as usual too, it saddened him; for he could never forget 
that she had disposed of herself for life in opposition to his 
wishes, though she had secretly assured him that she would never 
have consented had she been as old as she was now.</p>
<p>As on a former occasion, his wife wished to speak to him alone
about the girl&rsquo;s future, the time now drawing nigh at which
Reynard was expected to come and claim her.&nbsp; He would have 
done so already, but he had been put off by the earnest request 
of the young woman herself, which accorded with that of her 
parents, on the score of her youth.&nbsp; Reynard had 
deferentially submitted to their wishes in this respect, the 
understanding between them having been that he would not visit 
her before she was eighteen, except by the mutual consent of all 
parties.&nbsp; But this could not go on much longer, and there 
was no doubt, from the tenor of his last letter, that he would 
soon take possession of her whether or no.</p>
<p>To be out of the sound of this delicate discussion Betty was 
accordingly sent downstairs, and they soon saw her walking away 
into the shrubberies, looking very pretty in her sweeping green 
gown, and flapping broad-brimmed hat overhung with a feather.</p>
<p>On returning to the subject, Mrs. Dornell found her 
husband&rsquo;s reluctance to reply in the affirmative to 
Reynard&rsquo;s letter to be as great as ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is three months short of eighteen!&rsquo; he 
exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis too soon.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t 
hear of it!&nbsp; If I have to keep him off sword in hand, he 
shall not have her yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, my dear Thomas,&rsquo; she expostulated, 
&lsquo;consider if anything should happen to you or to me, how 
much better it would be that she should be settled in her home 
with him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say it is too soon!&rsquo; he argued, the veins of 
his forehead beginning to swell.&nbsp; &lsquo;If he gets her this
side o&rsquo; Candlemas I&rsquo;ll challenge en&mdash;I&rsquo;ll 
take my oath on&rsquo;t!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be back to 
King&rsquo;s-Hintock in two or three days, and I&rsquo;ll not 
lose sight of her day or night!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She feared to agitate him further, and gave way, assuring him,
in obedience to his demand, that if Reynard should write again 
before he got back, to fix a time for joining Betty, she would 
put the letter in her husband&rsquo;s hands, and he should do as 
he chose.&nbsp; This was all that required discussion privately, 
and Mrs. Dornell went to call in Betty, hoping that she had not 
heard her father&rsquo;s loud tones.</p>
<p>She had certainly not done so this time.&nbsp; Mrs. Dornell 
followed the path along which she had seen Betty wandering, but 
went a considerable distance without perceiving anything of 
her.&nbsp; The Squire&rsquo;s wife then turned round to proceed 
to the other side of the house by a short cut across the grass, 
when, to her surprise and consternation, she beheld the object of
her search sitting on the horizontal bough of a cedar, beside her
being a young man, whose arm was round her waist.&nbsp; He moved 
a little, and she recognized him as young Phelipson.</p>
<p>Alas, then, she was right.&nbsp; The so-called counterfeit 
love was real.&nbsp; What Mrs. Dornell called her husband at that
moment, for his folly in originally throwing the young people 
together, it is not necessary to mention.&nbsp; She decided in a 
moment not to let the lovers know that she had seen them.&nbsp; 
She accordingly retreated, reached the front of the house by 
another route, and called at the top of her voice from a window, 
&lsquo;Betty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>For the first time since her strategic marriage of the child, 
Susan Dornell doubted the wisdom of that step.</p>
<p>Her husband had, as it were, been assisted by destiny to make 
his objection, originally trivial, a valid one.&nbsp; She saw the
outlines of trouble in the future.&nbsp; Why had Dornell 
interfered?&nbsp; Why had he insisted upon producing his 
man?&nbsp; This, then, accounted for Betty&rsquo;s pleading for 
postponement whenever the subject of her husband&rsquo;s return 
was broached; this accounted for her attachment to 
Falls-Park.&nbsp; Possibly this very meeting that she had 
witnessed had been arranged by letter.</p>
<p>Perhaps the girl&rsquo;s thoughts would never have strayed for
a moment if her father had not filled her head with ideas of 
repugnance to her early union, on the ground that she had been 
coerced into it before she knew her own mind; and she might have 
rushed to meet her husband with open arms on the appointed 
day.</p>
<p>Betty at length appeared in the distance in answer to the 
call, and came up pale, but looking innocent of having seen a 
living soul.&nbsp; Mrs. Dornell groaned in spirit at such 
duplicity in the child of her bosom.&nbsp; This was the simple 
creature for whose development into womanhood they had all been 
so tenderly waiting&mdash;a forward minx, old enough not only to 
have a lover, but to conceal his existence as adroitly as any 
woman of the world!&nbsp; Bitterly did the Squire&rsquo;s lady 
regret that Stephen Reynard had not been allowed to come to claim
her at the time he first proposed.</p>
<p>The two sat beside each other almost in silence on their 
journey back to King&rsquo;s-Hintock.&nbsp; Such words as were 
spoken came mainly from Betty, and their formality indicated how 
much her mind and heart were occupied with other things.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dornell was far too astute a mother to openly attack 
Betty on the matter.&nbsp; That would be only fanning 
flame.&nbsp; The indispensable course seemed to her to be that of
keeping the treacherous girl under lock and key till her husband 
came to take her off her mother&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; That he 
would disregard Dornell&rsquo;s opposition, and come soon, was 
her devout wish.</p>
<p>It seemed, therefore, a fortunate coincidence that on her 
arrival at King&rsquo;s-Hintock a letter from Reynard was put 
into Mrs. Dornell&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; It was addressed to both 
her and her husband, and courteously informed them that the 
writer had landed at Bristol, and proposed to come on to 
King&rsquo;s-Hintock in a few days, at last to meet and carry off
his darling Betty, if she and her parents saw no objection.</p>
<p>Betty had also received a letter of the same tenor.&nbsp; Her 
mother had only to look at her face to see how the girl received 
the information.&nbsp; She was as pale as a sheet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must do your best to welcome him this time, my dear
Betty,&rsquo; her mother said gently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a woman now,&rsquo; added her mother severely, 
&lsquo;and these postponements must come to an end.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But my father&mdash;oh, I am sure he will not allow 
this!&nbsp; I am not ready.&nbsp; If he could only wait a year 
longer&mdash;if he could only wait a few months longer!&nbsp; Oh,
I wish&mdash;I wish my dear father were here!&nbsp; I will send 
to him instantly.&rsquo;&nbsp; She broke off abruptly, and 
falling upon her mother&rsquo;s neck, burst into tears, saying, 
&lsquo;O my mother, have mercy upon me&mdash;I do not love this 
man, my husband!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The agonized appeal went too straight to Mrs. Dornell&rsquo;s 
heart for her to hear it unmoved.&nbsp; Yet, things having come 
to this pass, what could she do?&nbsp; She was distracted, and 
for a moment was on Betty&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; Her original 
thought had been to write an affirmative reply to Reynard, allow 
him to come on to King&rsquo;s-Hintock, and keep her husband in 
ignorance of the whole proceeding till he should arrive from 
Falls on some fine day after his recovery, and find everything 
settled, and Reynard and Betty living together in harmony.&nbsp; 
But the events of the day, and her daughter&rsquo;s sudden 
outburst of feeling, had overthrown this intention.&nbsp; Betty 
was sure to do as she had threatened, and communicate instantly 
with her father, possibly attempt to fly to him.&nbsp; Moreover, 
Reynard&rsquo;s letter was addressed to Mr. Dornell and herself 
conjointly, and she could not in conscience keep it from her 
husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will send the letter on to your father 
instantly,&rsquo; she replied soothingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;He shall 
act entirely as he chooses, and you know that will not be in 
opposition to your wishes.&nbsp; He would ruin you rather than 
thwart you.&nbsp; I only hope he may be well enough to bear the 
agitation of this news.&nbsp; Do you agree to this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor Betty agreed, on condition that she should actually 
witness the despatch of the letter.&nbsp; Her mother had no 
objection to offer to this; but as soon as the horseman had 
cantered down the drive toward the highway, Mrs. Dornell&rsquo;s 
sympathy with Betty&rsquo;s recalcitration began to die 
out.&nbsp; The girl&rsquo;s secret affection for young Phelipson 
could not possibly be condoned.&nbsp; Betty might communicate 
with him, might even try to reach him.&nbsp; Ruin lay that 
way.&nbsp; Stephen Reynard must be speedily installed in his 
proper place by Betty&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>She sat down and penned a private letter to Reynard, which 
threw light upon her plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is Necessary that I should now tell you,&rsquo; she 
said, &lsquo;what I have never Mentioned before&mdash;indeed I 
may have signified the Contrary&mdash;that her Father&rsquo;s 
Objection to your joining her has not as yet been overcome.&nbsp;
As I personally Wish to delay you no longer&mdash;am indeed as 
anxious for your Arrival as you can be yourself, having the good 
of my Daughter at Heart&mdash;no course is left open to me but to
assist your Cause without my Husband&rsquo;s Knowledge.&nbsp; He,
I am sorry to say, is at present ill at Falls-Park, but I felt it
my Duty to forward him your Letter.&nbsp; He will therefore be 
like to reply with a peremptory Command to you to go back again, 
for some Months, whence you came, till the Time he originally 
stipulated has expir&rsquo;d.&nbsp; My Advice is, if you get such
a Letter, to take no Notice of it, but to come on hither as you 
had proposed, letting me know the Day and Hour (after dark, if 
possible) at which we may expect you.&nbsp; Dear Betty is with 
me, and I warrant ye that she shall be in the House when you 
arrive.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Mrs. Dornell, having sent away this epistle unsuspected of 
anybody, next took steps to prevent her daughter leaving the 
Court, avoiding if possible to excite the girl&rsquo;s suspicions
that she was under restraint.&nbsp; But, as if by divination, 
Betty had seemed to read the husband&rsquo;s approach in the 
aspect of her mother&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is coming!&rsquo; exclaimed the maiden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not for a week,&rsquo; her mother assured her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is then&mdash;for certain?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Betty hastily retired to her room, and would not be seen.</p>
<p>To lock her up, and hand over the key to Reynard when he 
should appear in the hall, was a plan charming in its simplicity,
till her mother found, on trying the door of the girl&rsquo;s 
chamber softly, that Betty had already locked and bolted it on 
the inside, and had given directions to have her meals served 
where she was, by leaving them on a dumb-waiter outside the 
door.</p>
<p>Thereupon Mrs. Dornell noiselessly sat down in her boudoir, 
which, as well as her bed-chamber, was a passage-room to the 
girl&rsquo;s apartment, and she resolved not to vacate her post 
night or day till her daughter&rsquo;s husband should appear, to 
which end she too arranged to breakfast, dine, and sup on the 
spot.&nbsp; It was impossible now that Betty should escape 
without her knowledge, even if she had wished, there being no 
other door to the chamber, except one admitting to a small inner 
dressing-room inaccessible by any second way.</p>
<p>But it was plain that the young girl had no thought of 
escape.&nbsp; Her ideas ran rather in the direction of 
intrenchment: she was prepared to stand a siege, but scorned 
flight.&nbsp; This, at any rate, rendered her secure.&nbsp; As to
how Reynard would contrive a meeting with her coy daughter while 
in such a defensive humour, that, thought her mother, must be 
left to his own ingenuity to discover.</p>
<p>Betty had looked so wild and pale at the announcement of her 
husband&rsquo;s approaching visit, that Mrs. Dornell, somewhat 
uneasy, could not leave her to herself.&nbsp; She peeped through 
the keyhole an hour later.&nbsp; Betty lay on the sofa, staring 
listlessly at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are looking ill, child,&rsquo; cried her 
mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve not taken the air lately.&nbsp;
Come with me for a drive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Betty made no objection.&nbsp; Soon they drove through the 
park towards the village, the daughter still in the strained, 
strung-up silence that had fallen upon her.&nbsp; They left the 
park to return by another route, and on the open road passed a 
cottage.</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s eye fell upon the cottage-window.&nbsp; Within 
it she saw a young girl about her own age, whom she knew by 
sight, sitting in a chair and propped by a pillow.&nbsp; The 
girl&rsquo;s face was covered with scales, which glistened in the
sun.&nbsp; She was a convalescent from smallpox&mdash;a disease 
whose prevalence at that period was a terror of which we at 
present can hardly form a conception.</p>
<p>An idea suddenly energized Betty&rsquo;s apathetic 
features.&nbsp; She glanced at her mother; Mrs. Dornell had been 
looking in the opposite direction.&nbsp; Betty said that she 
wished to go back to the cottage for a moment to speak to a girl 
in whom she took an interest.&nbsp; Mrs. Dornell appeared 
suspicious, but observing that the cottage had no back-door, and 
that Betty could not escape without being seen, she allowed the 
carriage to be stopped.&nbsp; Betty ran back and entered the 
cottage, emerging again in about a minute, and resuming her seat 
in the carriage.&nbsp; As they drove on she fixed her eyes upon 
her mother and said, &lsquo;There, I have done it 
now!&rsquo;&nbsp; Her pale face was stormy, and her eyes full of 
waiting tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have you done?&rsquo; said Mrs. Dornell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nanny Priddle is sick of the smallpox, and I saw her at
the window, and I went in and kissed her, so that I might take 
it; and now I shall have it, and he won&rsquo;t be able to come 
near me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wicked girl!&rsquo; cries her mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, 
what am I to do!&nbsp; What&mdash;bring a distemper on yourself, 
and usurp the sacred prerogative of God, because you can&rsquo;t 
palate the man you&rsquo;ve wedded!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The alarmed woman gave orders to drive home as rapidly as 
possible, and on arriving, Betty, who was by this time also 
somewhat frightened at her own enormity, was put into a bath, and
fumigated, and treated in every way that could be thought of to 
ward off the dreadful malady that in a rash moment she had tried 
to acquire.</p>
<p>There was now a double reason for isolating the rebellious 
daughter and wife in her own chamber, and there she accordingly 
remained for the rest of the day and the days that followed; till
no ill results seemed likely to arise from her wilfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Meanwhile the first letter from Reynard, announcing to Mrs. 
Dornell and her husband jointly that he was coming in a few days,
had sped on its way to Falls-Park.&nbsp; It was directed under 
cover to Tupcombe, the confidential servant, with instructions 
not to put it into his master&rsquo;s hands till he had been 
refreshed by a good long sleep.&nbsp; Tupcombe much regretted his
commission, letters sent in this way always disturbing the 
Squire; but guessing that it would be infinitely worse in the end
to withhold the news than to reveal it, he chose his time, which 
was early the next morning, and delivered the missive.</p>
<p>The utmost effect that Mrs. Dornell had anticipated from the 
message was a peremptory order from her husband to Reynard to 
hold aloof a few months longer.&nbsp; What the Squire really did 
was to declare that he would go himself and confront Reynard at 
Bristol, and have it out with him there by word of mouth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, master,&rsquo; said Tupcombe, &lsquo;you 
can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You cannot get out of bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You leave the room, Tupcombe, and don&rsquo;t say 
&ldquo;can&rsquo;t&rdquo; before me!&nbsp; Have Jerry saddled in 
an hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The long-tried Tupcombe thought his employer demented, so 
utterly helpless was his appearance just then, and he went out 
reluctantly.&nbsp; No sooner was he gone than the Squire, with 
great difficulty, stretched himself over to a cabinet by the 
bedside, unlocked it, and took out a small bottle.&nbsp; It 
contained a gout specific, against whose use he had been 
repeatedly warned by his regular physician, but whose warning he 
now cast to the winds.</p>
<p>He took a double dose, and waited half an hour.&nbsp; It 
seemed to produce no effect.&nbsp; He then poured out a treble 
dose, swallowed it, leant back upon his pillow, and waited.&nbsp;
The miracle he anticipated had been worked at last.&nbsp; It 
seemed as though the second draught had not only operated with 
its own strength, but had kindled into power the latent forces of
the first.&nbsp; He put away the bottle, and rang up 
Tupcombe.</p>
<p>Less than an hour later one of the housemaids, who of course 
was quite aware that the Squire&rsquo;s illness was serious, was 
surprised to hear a bold and decided step descending the stairs 
from the direction of Mr. Dornell&rsquo;s room, accompanied by 
the humming of a tune.&nbsp; She knew that the doctor had not 
paid a visit that morning, and that it was too heavy to be the 
valet or any other man-servant.&nbsp; Looking up, she saw Squire 
Dornell fully dressed, descending toward her in his drab caped 
riding-coat and boots, with the swinging easy movement of his 
prime.&nbsp; Her face expressed her amazement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What the devil beest looking at?&rsquo; said the 
Squire.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you never see a man walk out of his 
house before, wench?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Resuming his humming&mdash;which was of a defiant 
sort&mdash;he proceeded to the library, rang the bell, asked if 
the horses were ready, and directed them to be brought 
round.&nbsp; Ten minutes later he rode away in the direction of 
Bristol, Tupcombe behind him, trembling at what these movements 
might portend.</p>
<p>They rode on through the pleasant woodlands and the monotonous
straight lanes at an equal pace.&nbsp; The distance traversed 
might have been about fifteen miles when Tupcombe could perceive 
that the Squire was getting tired&mdash;as weary as he would have
been after riding three times the distance ten years 
before.&nbsp; However, they reached Bristol without any mishap, 
and put up at the Squire&rsquo;s accustomed inn.&nbsp; Dornell 
almost immediately proceeded on foot to the inn which Reynard had
given as his address, it being now about four o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Reynard had already dined&mdash;for people dined early 
then&mdash;and he was staying indoors.&nbsp; He had already 
received Mrs. Dornell&rsquo;s reply to his letter; but before 
acting upon her advice and starting for King&rsquo;s-Hintock he 
made up his mind to wait another day, that Betty&rsquo;s father 
might at least have time to write to him if so minded.&nbsp; The 
returned traveller much desired to obtain the Squire&rsquo;s 
assent, as well as his wife&rsquo;s, to the proposed visit to his
bride, that nothing might seem harsh or forced in his method of 
taking his position as one of the family.&nbsp; But though he 
anticipated some sort of objection from his father-in-law, in 
consequence of Mrs. Dornell&rsquo;s warning, he was surprised at 
the announcement of the Squire in person.</p>
<p>Stephen Reynard formed the completest of possible contrasts to
Dornell as they stood confronting each other in the best parlour 
of the Bristol tavern.&nbsp; The Squire, hot-tempered, gouty, 
impulsive, generous, reckless; the younger man, pale, tall, 
sedate, self-possessed&mdash;a man of the world, fully bearing 
out at least one couplet in his epitaph, still extant in 
King&rsquo;s-Hintock church, which places in the inventory of his
good qualities</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Engaging Manners, cultivated Mind,<br />
Adorn&rsquo;d by Letters, and in Courts refin&rsquo;d.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was at this time about five-and-thirty, though careful 
living and an even, unemotional temperament caused him to look 
much younger than his years.</p>
<p>Squire Dornell plunged into his errand without much ceremony 
or preface.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am your humble servant, sir,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I have read your letter writ to my wife and myself, and 
considered that the best way to answer it would be to do so in 
person.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am vastly honoured by your visit, sir,&rsquo; said 
Mr. Stephen Reynard, bowing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be undone,&rsquo; 
said Dornell, &lsquo;though it was mighty early, and was no doing
of mine.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s your wife; and there&rsquo;s an end 
on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But in brief, sir, she&rsquo;s too young for 
you to claim yet; we mustn&rsquo;t reckon by years; we must 
reckon by nature.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s still a girl; &rsquo;tis 
onpolite of &rsquo;ee to come yet; next year will be full soon 
enough for you to take her to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, courteous as Reynard could be, he was a little obstinate 
when his resolution had once been formed.&nbsp; She had been 
promised him by her eighteenth birthday at latest&mdash;sooner if
she were in robust health.&nbsp; Her mother had fixed the time on
her own judgment, without a word of interference on his 
part.&nbsp; He had been hanging about foreign courts till he was 
weary.&nbsp; Betty was now as woman, if she would ever be one, 
and there was not, in his mind, the shadow of an excuse for 
putting him off longer.&nbsp; Therefore, fortified as he was by 
the support of her mother, he blandly but firmly told the Squire 
that he had been willing to waive his rights, out of deference to
her parents, to any reasonable extent, but must now, in justice 
to himself and her insist on maintaining them.&nbsp; He 
therefore, since she had not come to meet him, should proceed to 
King&rsquo;s-Hintock in a few days to fetch her.</p>
<p>This announcement, in spite of the urbanity with which it was 
delivered, set Dornell in a passion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh dammy, sir; you talk about rights, you do, after 
stealing her away, a mere child, against my will and 
knowledge!&nbsp; If we&rsquo;d begged and prayed &rsquo;ee to 
take her, you could say no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon my honour, your charge is quite baseless, 
sir,&rsquo; said his son-in-law.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must know by 
this time&mdash;or if you do not, it has been a monstrous cruel 
injustice to me that I should have been allowed to remain in your
mind with such a stain upon my character&mdash;you must know that
I used no seductiveness or temptation of any kind.&nbsp; Her 
mother assented; she assented.&nbsp; I took them at their 
word.&nbsp; That you was really opposed to the marriage was not 
known to me till afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dornell professed to believe not a word of it.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have her till she&rsquo;s dree 
sixes full&mdash;no maid ought to be married till she&rsquo;s 
dree sixes!&mdash;and my daughter sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be treated 
out of nater!&rsquo;&nbsp; So he stormed on till Tupcombe, who 
had been alarmedly listening in the next room, entered suddenly, 
declaring to Reynard that his master&rsquo;s life was in danger 
if the interview were prolonged, he being subject to apoplectic 
strokes at these crises.&nbsp; Reynard immediately said that he 
would be the last to wish to injure Squire Dornell, and left the 
room, and as soon as the Squire had recovered breath and 
equanimity, he went out of the inn, leaning on the arm of 
Tupcombe.</p>
<p>Tupcombe was for sleeping in Bristol that night, but Dornell, 
whose energy seemed as invincible as it was sudden, insisted upon
mounting and getting back as far as Falls-Park, to continue the 
journey to King&rsquo;s-Hintock on the following day.&nbsp; At 
five they started, and took the southern road toward the Mendip 
Hills.&nbsp; The evening was dry and windy, and, excepting that 
the sun did not shine, strongly reminded Tupcombe of the evening 
of that March month, nearly five years earlier, when news had 
been brought to King&rsquo;s-Hintock Court of the child 
Betty&rsquo;s marriage in London&mdash;news which had produced 
upon Dornell such a marked effect for the worse ever since, and 
indirectly upon the household of which he was the head.&nbsp; 
Before that time the winters were lively at Falls-Park, as well 
as at King&rsquo;s-Hintock, although the Squire had ceased to 
make it his regular residence.&nbsp; Hunting-guests and 
shooting-guests came and went, and open house was kept.&nbsp; 
Tupcombe disliked the clever courtier who had put a stop to this 
by taking away from the Squire the only treasure he valued.</p>
<p>It grew darker with their progress along the lanes, and 
Tupcombe discovered from Mr. Dornell&rsquo;s manner of riding 
that his strength was giving way; and spurring his own horse 
close alongside, he asked him how he felt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, bad; damn bad, Tupcombe!&nbsp; I can hardly keep my
seat.&nbsp; I shall never be any better, I fear!&nbsp; Have we 
passed Three-Man-Gibbet yet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not yet by a long ways, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish we had.&nbsp; I can hardly hold on.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Squire could not repress a groan now and then, and Tupcombe 
knew he was in great pain.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish I was 
underground&mdash;that&rsquo;s the place for such fools as 
I!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d gladly be there if it were not for Mistress 
Betty.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s coming on to King&rsquo;s-Hintock 
to-morrow&mdash;he won&rsquo;t put it off any longer; he&rsquo;ll
set out and reach there to-morrow night, without stopping at 
Falls; and he&rsquo;ll take her unawares, and I want to be there 
before him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you may be well enough to do it, sir.&nbsp; But 
really&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I <i>must</i>, Tupcombe!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know 
what my trouble is; it is not so much that she is married to this
man without my agreeing&mdash;for, after all, there&rsquo;s 
nothing to say against him, so far as I know; but that she 
don&rsquo;t take to him at all, seems to fear him&mdash;in fact, 
cares nothing about him; and if he comes forcing himself into the
house upon her, why, &rsquo;twill be rank cruelty.&nbsp; Would to
the Lord something would happen to prevent him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>How they reached home that night Tupcombe hardly knew.&nbsp; 
The Squire was in such pain that he was obliged to recline upon 
his horse, and Tupcombe was afraid every moment lest he would 
fall into the road.&nbsp; But they did reach home at last, and 
Mr. Dornell was instantly assisted to bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Next morning it was obvious that he could not possibly go to 
King&rsquo;s-Hintock for several days at least, and there on the 
bed he lay, cursing his inability to proceed on an errand so 
personal and so delicate that no emissary could perform it.&nbsp;
What he wished to do was to ascertain from Betty&rsquo;s own lips
if her aversion to Reynard was so strong that his presence would 
be positively distasteful to her.&nbsp; Were that the case, he 
would have borne her away bodily on the saddle behind him.</p>
<p>But all that was hindered now, and he repeated a hundred times
in Tupcombe&rsquo;s hearing, and in that of the nurse and other 
servants, &lsquo;I wish to God something would happen to 
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This sentiment, reiterated by the Squire as he tossed in the 
agony induced by the powerful drugs of the day before, entered 
sharply into the soul of Tupcombe and of all who were attached to
the house of Dornell, as distinct from the house of his wife at 
King&rsquo;s-Hintock.&nbsp; Tupcombe, who was an excitable man, 
was hardly less disquieted by the thought of Reynard&rsquo;s 
return than the Squire himself was.&nbsp; As the week drew on, 
and the afternoon advanced at which Reynard would in all 
probability be passing near Falls on his way to the Court, the 
Squire&rsquo;s feelings became acuter, and the responsive 
Tupcombe could hardly bear to come near him.&nbsp; Having left 
him in the hands of the doctor, the former went out upon the 
lawn, for he could hardly breathe in the contagion of excitement 
caught from the employer who had virtually made him his 
confidant.&nbsp; He had lived with the Dornells from his boyhood,
had been born under the shadow of their walls; his whole life was
annexed and welded to the life of the family in a degree which 
has no counterpart in these latter days.</p>
<p>He was summoned indoors, and learnt that it had been decided 
to send for Mrs. Dornell: her husband was in great danger.&nbsp; 
There were two or three who could have acted as messenger, but 
Dornell wished Tupcombe to go, the reason showing itself when, 
Tupcombe being ready to start, Squire Dornell summoned him to his
chamber and leaned down so that he could whisper in his ear:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put Peggy along smart, Tupcombe, and get there before 
him, you know&mdash;before him.&nbsp; This is the day he 
fixed.&nbsp; He has not passed Falls cross-roads yet.&nbsp; If 
you can do that you will be able to get Betty to 
come&mdash;d&rsquo;ye see?&mdash;after her mother has started; 
she&rsquo;ll have a reason for not waiting for him.&nbsp; Bring 
her by the lower road&mdash;he&rsquo;ll go by the upper.&nbsp; 
Your business is to make &rsquo;em miss each 
other&mdash;d&rsquo;ye see?&mdash;but that&rsquo;s a thing I 
couldn&rsquo;t write down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes after, Tupcombe was astride the horse and on his 
way&mdash;the way he had followed so many times since his master,
a florid young countryman, had first gone wooing to 
King&rsquo;s-Hintock Court.&nbsp; As soon as he had crossed the 
hills in the immediate neighbourhood of the manor, the road lay 
over a plain, where it ran in long straight stretches for several
miles.&nbsp; In the best of times, when all had been gay in the 
united houses, that part of the road had seemed tedious.&nbsp; It
was gloomy in the extreme now that he pursued it, at night and 
alone, on such an errand.</p>
<p>He rode and brooded.&nbsp; If the Squire were to die, he, 
Tupcombe, would be alone in the world and friendless, for he was 
no favourite with Mrs. Dornell; and to find himself baffled, 
after all, in what he had set his mind on, would probably kill 
the Squire.&nbsp; Thinking thus, Tupcombe stopped his horse every
now and then, and listened for the coming husband.&nbsp; The time
was drawing on to the moment when Reynard might be expected to 
pass along this very route.&nbsp; He had watched the road well 
during the afternoon, and had inquired of the tavern-keepers as 
he came up to each, and he was convinced that the premature 
descent of the stranger-husband upon his young mistress had not 
been made by this highway as yet.</p>
<p>Besides the girl&rsquo;s mother, Tupcombe was the only member 
of the household who suspected Betty&rsquo;s tender feelings 
towards young Phelipson, so unhappily generated on her return 
from school; and he could therefore imagine, even better than her
fond father, what would be her emotions on the sudden 
announcement of Reynard&rsquo;s advent that evening at 
King&rsquo;s-Hintock Court.</p>
<p>So he rode and rode, desponding and hopeful by turns.&nbsp; He
felt assured that, unless in the unfortunate event of the almost 
immediate arrival of her son-in law at his own heels, Mrs. 
Dornell would not be able to hinder Betty&rsquo;s departure for 
her father&rsquo;s bedside.</p>
<p>It was about nine o&rsquo;clock that, having put twenty miles 
of country behind him, he turned in at the lodge-gate nearest to 
Ivell and King&rsquo;s-Hintock village, and pursued the long 
north drive&mdash;itself much like a turnpike road&mdash;which 
led thence through the park to the Court.&nbsp; Though there were
so many trees in King&rsquo;s-Hintock park, few bordered the 
carriage roadway; he could see it stretching ahead in the pale 
night light like an unrolled deal shaving.&nbsp; Presently the 
irregular frontage of the house came in view, of great extent, 
but low, except where it rose into the outlines of a broad square
tower.</p>
<p>As Tupcombe approached he rode aside upon the grass, to make 
sure, if possible, that he was the first comer, before letting 
his presence be known.&nbsp; The Court was dark and sleepy, in no
respect as if a bridegroom were about to arrive.</p>
<p>While pausing he distinctly heard the tread of a horse upon 
the track behind him, and for a moment despaired of arriving in 
time: here, surely, was Reynard!&nbsp; Pulling up closer to the 
densest tree at hand he waited, and found he had retreated 
nothing too soon, for the second rider avoided the gravel also, 
and passed quite close to him.&nbsp; In the profile he recognized
young Phelipson.</p>
<p>Before Tupcombe could think what to do, Phelipson had gone on;
but not to the door of the house.&nbsp; Swerving to the left, he 
passed round to the east angle, where, as Tupcombe knew, were 
situated Betty&rsquo;s apartments.&nbsp; Dismounting, he left the
horse tethered to a hanging bough, and walked on to the 
house.</p>
<p>Suddenly his eye caught sight of an object which explained the
position immediately.&nbsp; It was a ladder stretching from 
beneath the trees, which there came pretty close to the house, up
to a first-floor window&mdash;one which lighted Miss 
Betty&rsquo;s rooms.&nbsp; Yes, it was Betty&rsquo;s chamber; he 
knew every room in the house well.</p>
<p>The young horseman who had passed him, having evidently left 
his steed somewhere under the trees also, was perceptible at the 
top of the ladder, immediately outside Betty&rsquo;s 
window.&nbsp; While Tupcombe watched, a cloaked female figure 
stepped timidly over the sill, and the two cautiously descended, 
one before the other, the young man&rsquo;s arms enclosing the 
young woman between his grasp of the ladder, so that she could 
not fall.&nbsp; As soon as they reached the bottom, young 
Phelipson quickly removed the ladder and hid it under the 
bushes.&nbsp; The pair disappeared; till, in a few minutes, 
Tupcombe could discern a horse emerging from a remoter part of 
the umbrage.&nbsp; The horse carried double, the girl being on a 
pillion behind her lover.</p>
<p>Tupcombe hardly knew what to do or think; yet, though this was
not exactly the kind of flight that had been intended, she had 
certainly escaped.&nbsp; He went back to his own animal, and rode
round to the servants&rsquo; door, where he delivered the letter 
for Mrs. Dornell.&nbsp; To leave a verbal message for Betty was 
now impossible.</p>
<p>The Court servants desired him to stay over the night, but he 
would not do so, desiring to get back to the Squire as soon as 
possible and tell what he had seen.&nbsp; Whether he ought not to
have intercepted the young people, and carried off Betty himself 
to her father, he did not know.&nbsp; However, it was too late to
think of that now, and without wetting his lips or swallowing a 
crumb, Tupcombe turned his back upon King&rsquo;s-Hintock 
Court.</p>
<p>It was not till he had advanced a considerable distance on his
way homeward that, halting under the lantern of a roadside-inn 
while the horse was watered, there came a traveller from the 
opposite direction in a hired coach; the lantern lit the 
stranger&rsquo;s face as he passed along and dropped into the 
shade.&nbsp; Tupcombe exulted for the moment, though he could 
hardly have justified his exultation.&nbsp; The belated traveller
was Reynard; and another had stepped in before him.</p>
<p>You may now be willing to know of the fortunes of Miss 
Betty.&nbsp; Left much to herself through the intervening days, 
she had ample time to brood over her desperate attempt at the 
stratagem of infection&mdash;thwarted, apparently, by her 
mother&rsquo;s promptitude.&nbsp; In what other way to gain time 
she could not think.&nbsp; Thus drew on the day and the hour of 
the evening on which her husband was expected to announce 
himself.</p>
<p>At some period after dark, when she could not tell, a tap at 
the window, twice and thrice repeated, became audible.&nbsp; It 
caused her to start up, for the only visitant in her mind was the
one whose advances she had so feared as to risk health and life 
to repel them.&nbsp; She crept to the window, and heard a whisper
without.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is I&mdash;Charley,&rsquo; said the voice.</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s face fired with excitement.&nbsp; She had 
latterly begun to doubt her admirer&rsquo;s staunchness, fancying
his love to be going off in mere attentions which neither 
committed him nor herself very deeply.&nbsp; She opened the 
window, saying in a joyous whisper, &lsquo;Oh Charley; I thought 
you had deserted me quite!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He assured her he had not done that, and that he had a horse 
in waiting, if she would ride off with him.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must
come quickly,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;for Reynard&rsquo;s on the 
way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>To throw a cloak round herself was the work of a moment, and 
assuring herself that her door was locked against a surprise, she
climbed over the window-sill and descended with him as we have 
seen.</p>
<p>Her mother meanwhile, having received Tupcombe&rsquo;s note, 
found the news of her husband&rsquo;s illness so serious, as to 
displace her thoughts of the coming son-in-law, and she hastened 
to tell her daughter of the Squire&rsquo;s dangerous condition, 
thinking it might be desirable to take her to her father&rsquo;s 
bedside.&nbsp; On trying the door of the girl&rsquo;s room, she 
found it still locked.&nbsp; Mrs. Dornell called, but there was 
no answer.&nbsp; Full of misgivings, she privately fetched the 
old house-steward and bade him burst open the door&mdash;an order
by no means easy to execute, the joinery of the Court being 
massively constructed.&nbsp; However, the lock sprang open at 
last, and she entered Betty&rsquo;s chamber only to find the 
window unfastened and the bird flown.</p>
<p>For a moment Mrs. Dornell was staggered.&nbsp; Then it 
occurred to her that Betty might have privately obtained from 
Tupcombe the news of her father&rsquo;s serious illness, and, 
fearing she might be kept back to meet her husband, have gone off
with that obstinate and biassed servitor to Falls-Park.&nbsp; The
more she thought it over the more probable did the supposition 
appear; and binding her own head-man to secrecy as to 
Betty&rsquo;s movements, whether as she conjectured, or 
otherwise, Mrs. Dornell herself prepared to set out.</p>
<p>She had no suspicion how seriously her husband&rsquo;s malady 
had been aggravated by his ride to Bristol, and thought more of 
Betty&rsquo;s affairs than of her own.&nbsp; That Betty&rsquo;s 
husband should arrive by some other road to-night, and find 
neither wife nor mother-in-law to receive him, and no explanation
of their absence, was possible; but never forgetting chances, 
Mrs. Dornell as she journeyed kept her eyes fixed upon the 
highway on the off-side, where, before she had reached the town 
of Ivell, the hired coach containing Stephen Reynard flashed into
the lamplight of her own carriage.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dornell&rsquo;s coachman pulled up, in obedience to a 
direction she had given him at starting; the other coach was 
hailed, a few words passed, and Reynard alighted and came to Mrs.
Dornell&rsquo;s carriage-window.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come inside,&rsquo; says she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want to 
speak privately to you.&nbsp; Why are you so late?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One hindrance and another,&rsquo; says he.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I meant to be at the Court by eight at latest.&nbsp; My 
gratitude for your letter.&nbsp; I hope&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not try to see Betty yet,&rsquo; said 
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;There be far other and newer reasons against 
your seeing her now than there were when I wrote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The circumstances were such that Mrs. Dornell could not 
possibly conceal them entirely; nothing short of knowing some of 
the facts would prevent his blindly acting in a manner which 
might be fatal to the future.&nbsp; Moreover, there are times 
when deeper intriguers than Mrs. Dornell feel that they must let 
out a few truths, if only in self-indulgence.&nbsp; So she told 
so much of recent surprises as that Betty&rsquo;s heart had been 
attracted by another image than his, and that his insisting on 
visiting her now might drive the girl to desperation.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Betty has, in fact, rushed off to her father to avoid 
you,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But if you wait she will soon 
forget this young man, and you will have nothing to 
fear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As a woman and a mother she could go no further, and 
Betty&rsquo;s desperate attempt to infect herself the week before
as a means of repelling him, together with the alarming 
possibility that, after all, she had not gone to her father but 
to her lover, was not revealed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; sighed the diplomatist, in a tone 
unexpectedly quiet, &lsquo;such things have been known 
before.&nbsp; After all, she may prefer me to him some day, when 
she reflects how very differently I might have acted than I am 
going to act towards her.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll say no more about 
that now.&nbsp; I can have a bed at your house for 
to-night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-night, certainly.&nbsp; And you leave to-morrow 
morning early?&rsquo;&nbsp; She spoke anxiously, for on no 
account did she wish him to make further discoveries.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;My husband is so seriously ill,&rsquo; she continued, 
&lsquo;that my absence and Betty&rsquo;s on your arrival is 
naturally accounted for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He promised to leave early, and to write to her soon.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;And when I think the time is ripe,&rsquo; he said, 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll write to her.&nbsp; I may have something to 
tell her that will bring her to graciousness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was about one o&rsquo;clock in the morning when Mrs. 
Dornell reached Falls-Park.&nbsp; A double blow awaited her 
there.&nbsp; Betty had not arrived; her flight had been 
elsewhither; and her stricken mother divined with whom.&nbsp; She
ascended to the bedside of her husband, where to her concern she 
found that the physician had given up all hope.&nbsp; The Squire 
was sinking, and his extreme weakness had almost changed his 
character, except in the particular that his old obstinacy 
sustained him in a refusal to see a clergyman.&nbsp; He shed 
tears at the least word, and sobbed at the sight of his 
wife.&nbsp; He asked for Betty, and it was with a heavy heart 
that Mrs. Dornell told him that the girl had not accompanied 
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not keeping her away?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no.&nbsp; He is going back&mdash;he is not coming 
to her for some time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what is detaining her&mdash;cruel, neglectful 
maid!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, Thomas; she is&mdash; She could not 
come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somehow the solemnity of these last moments of his gave him 
inquisitorial power, and the too cold wife could not conceal from
him the flight which had taken place from King&rsquo;s-Hintock 
that night.</p>
<p>To her amazement, the effect upon him was electrical.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;Betty&mdash;a trump after all?&nbsp; 
Hurrah!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s her father&rsquo;s own maid!&nbsp; 
She&rsquo;s game!&nbsp; She knew he was her father&rsquo;s own 
choice!&nbsp; She vowed that my man should win!&nbsp; Well done, 
Bet!&mdash;haw! haw!&nbsp; Hurrah!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had raised himself in bed by starts as he spoke, and now 
fell back exhausted.&nbsp; He never uttered another word, and 
died before the dawn.&nbsp; People said there had not been such 
an ungenteel death in a good county family for years.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Now I will go back to the time of Betty&rsquo;s riding off on 
the pillion behind her lover.&nbsp; They left the park by an 
obscure gate to the east, and presently found themselves in the 
lonely and solitary length of the old Roman road now called 
Long-Ash Lane.</p>
<p>By this time they were rather alarmed at their own 
performance, for they were both young and inexperienced.&nbsp; 
Hence they proceeded almost in silence till they came to a mean 
roadside inn which was not yet closed; when Betty, who had held 
on to him with much misgiving all this while, felt dreadfully 
unwell, and said she thought she would like to get down.</p>
<p>They accordingly dismounted from the jaded animal that had 
brought them, and were shown into a small dark parlour, where 
they stood side by side awkwardly, like the fugitives they 
were.&nbsp; A light was brought, and when they were left alone 
Betty threw off the cloak which had enveloped her.&nbsp; No 
sooner did young Phelipson see her face than he uttered an 
alarmed exclamation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Lord, Lord, you are sickening for the 
small-pox!&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh&mdash;I forgot!&rsquo; faltered Betty.&nbsp; And 
then she informed him that, on hearing of her husband&rsquo;s 
approach the week before, in a desperate attempt to keep him from
her side, she had tried to imbibe the infection&mdash;an act 
which till this moment she had supposed to have been ineffectual,
imagining her feverishness to be the result of her 
excitement.</p>
<p>The effect of this discovery upon young Phelipson was 
overwhelming.&nbsp; Better-seasoned men than he would not have 
been proof against it, and he was only a little over her own 
age.&nbsp; &lsquo;And you&rsquo;ve been holding on to me!&rsquo; 
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;And suppose you get worse, and we both have
it, what shall we do?&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you be a fright in a 
month or two, poor, poor Betty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In his horror he attempted to laugh, but the laugh ended in a 
weakly giggle.&nbsp; She was more woman than girl by this time, 
and realized his feeling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;in trying to keep off him, I keep off 
you?&rsquo; she said miserably.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you hate me 
because I am going to be ugly and ill?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh&mdash;no, no!&rsquo; he said soothingly.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;But I&mdash;I am thinking if it is quite right for us to 
do this.&nbsp; You see, dear Betty, if you was not married it 
would be different.&nbsp; You are not in honour married to him 
we&rsquo;ve often said; still you are his by law, and you 
can&rsquo;t be mine whilst he&rsquo;s alive.&nbsp; And with this 
terrible sickness coming on, perhaps you had better let me take 
you back, and&mdash;climb in at the window again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is <i>this</i> your love?&rsquo; said Betty 
reproachfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, if you was sickening for the 
plague itself, and going to be as ugly as the Ooser in the 
church-vestry, I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, you mistake, upon my soul!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Betty with a swollen heart had rewrapped herself and gone 
out of the door.&nbsp; The horse was still standing there.&nbsp; 
She mounted by the help of the upping-stock, and when he had 
followed her she said, &lsquo;Do not come near me, Charley; but 
please lead the horse, so that if you&rsquo;ve not caught 
anything already you&rsquo;ll not catch it going back.&nbsp; 
After all, what keeps off you may keep off him.&nbsp; Now 
onward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did not resist her command, and back they went by the way 
they had come, Betty shedding bitter tears at the retribution she
had already brought upon herself; for though she had reproached 
Phelipson, she was staunch enough not to blame him in her secret 
heart for showing that his love was only skin-deep.&nbsp; The 
horse was stopped in the plantation, and they walked silently to 
the lawn, reaching the bushes wherein the ladder still lay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you put it up for me?&rsquo; she asked 
mournfully.</p>
<p>He re-erected the ladder without a word; but when she 
approached to ascend he said, &lsquo;Good-bye, Betty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye!&rsquo; said she; and involuntarily turned her
face towards his.&nbsp; He hung back from imprinting the expected
kiss: at which Betty started as if she had received a poignant 
wound.&nbsp; She moved away so suddenly that he hardly had time 
to follow her up the ladder to prevent her falling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell your mother to get the doctor at once!&rsquo; he 
said anxiously.</p>
<p>She stepped in without looking behind; he descended, withdrew 
the ladder, and went away.</p>
<p>Alone in her chamber, Betty flung herself upon her face on the
bed, and burst into shaking sobs.&nbsp; Yet she would not admit 
to herself that her lover&rsquo;s conduct was unreasonable; only 
that her rash act of the previous week had been wrong.&nbsp; No 
one had heard her enter, and she was too worn out, in body and 
mind, to think or care about medical aid.&nbsp; In an hour or so 
she felt yet more unwell, positively ill; and nobody coming to 
her at the usual bedtime, she looked towards the door.&nbsp; 
Marks of the lock having been forced were visible, and this made 
her chary of summoning a servant.&nbsp; She opened the door 
cautiously and sallied forth downstairs.</p>
<p>In the dining-parlour, as it was called, the now sick and 
sorry Betty was startled to see at that late hour not her mother,
but a man sitting, calmly finishing his supper.&nbsp; There was 
no servant in the room.&nbsp; He turned, and she recognized her 
husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s my mamma?&rsquo; she demanded without 
preface.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone to your father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Is 
that&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; He stopped, aghast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; This spotted object is your wife!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve done it because I don&rsquo;t want you to come near 
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was sixteen years her senior; old enough to be 
compassionate.&nbsp; &lsquo;My poor child, you must get to bed 
directly!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be afraid of me&mdash;I&rsquo;ll 
carry you upstairs, and send for a doctor instantly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you don&rsquo;t know what I am!&rsquo; she 
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had a lover once; but now he&rsquo;s 
gone!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t I who deserted him.&nbsp; He has
deserted me; because I am ill he wouldn&rsquo;t kiss me, though I
wanted him to!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; Then he was a very poor 
slack-twisted sort of fellow.&nbsp; Betty, <i>I&rsquo;ve</i> 
never kissed you since you stood beside me as my little wife, 
twelve years and a half old!&nbsp; May I kiss you now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though Betty by no means desired his kisses, she had enough of
the spirit of Cunigonde in Schiller&rsquo;s ballad to test his 
daring.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you have courage to venture, yes 
sir!&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;But you may die for it, 
mind!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He came up to her and imprinted a deliberate kiss full upon 
her mouth, saying, &lsquo;May many others follow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head, and hastily withdrew, though secretly 
pleased at his hardihood.&nbsp; The excitement had supported her 
for the few minutes she had passed in his presence, and she could
hardly drag herself back to her room.&nbsp; Her husband summoned 
the servants, and, sending them to her assistance, went off 
himself for a doctor.</p>
<p>The next morning Reynard waited at the Court till he had 
learnt from the medical man that Betty&rsquo;s attack promised to
be a very light one&mdash;or, as it was expressed, &lsquo;very 
fine&rsquo;; and in taking his leave sent up a note to her:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I must be Gone.&nbsp; I promised your Mother I 
would not see You yet, and she may be anger&rsquo;d if she finds 
me here.&nbsp; Promise to see me as Soon as you are 
well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was of all men then living one of the best able to cope 
with such an untimely situation as this.&nbsp; A contriving, 
sagacious, gentle-mannered man, a philosopher who saw that the 
only constant attribute of life is change, he held that, as long 
as she lives, there is nothing finite in the most impassioned 
attitude a woman may take up.&nbsp; In twelve months his 
girl-wife&rsquo;s recent infatuation might be as distasteful to 
her mind as it was now to his own.&nbsp; In a few years her very 
flesh would change&mdash;so said the scientific;&mdash;her 
spirit, so much more ephemeral, was capable of changing in 
one.&nbsp; Betty was his, and it became a mere question of means 
how to effect that change.</p>
<p>During the day Mrs. Dornell, having closed her husband&rsquo;s
eyes, returned to the Court.&nbsp; She was truly relieved to find
Betty there, even though on a bed of sickness.&nbsp; The disease 
ran its course, and in due time Betty became convalescent, 
without having suffered deeply for her rashness, one little speck
beneath her ear, and one beneath her chin, being all the marks 
she retained.</p>
<p>The Squire&rsquo;s body was not brought back to 
King&rsquo;s-Hintock.&nbsp; Where he was born, and where he had 
lived before wedding his Sue, there he had wished to be 
buried.&nbsp; No sooner had she lost him than Mrs. Dornell, like 
certain other wives, though she had never shown any great 
affection for him while he lived, awoke suddenly to his many 
virtues, and zealously embraced his opinion about delaying 
Betty&rsquo;s union with her husband, which she had formerly 
combated strenuously.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor man! how right he was, 
and how wrong was I!&rsquo;&nbsp; Eighteen was certainly the 
lowest age at which Mr. Reynard should claim her child&mdash;nay,
it was too low!&nbsp; Far too low!</p>
<p>So desirous was she of honouring her lamented husband&rsquo;s 
sentiments in this respect, that she wrote to her son-in-law 
suggesting that, partly on account of Betty&rsquo;s sorrow for 
her father&rsquo;s loss, and out of consideration for his known 
wishes for delay, Betty should not be taken from her till her 
nineteenth birthday.</p>
<p>However much or little Stephen Reynard might have been to 
blame in his marriage, the patient man now almost deserved to be 
pitied.&nbsp; First Betty&rsquo;s skittishness; now her 
mother&rsquo;s remorseful <i>volte-face</i>: it was enough to 
exasperate anybody; and he wrote to the widow in a tone which led
to a little coolness between those hitherto firm friends.&nbsp; 
However, knowing that he had a wife not to claim but to win, and 
that young Phelipson had been packed off to sea by his parents, 
Stephen was complaisant to a degree, returning to London, and 
holding quite aloof from Betty and her mother, who remained for 
the present in the country.&nbsp; In town he had a mild 
visitation of the distemper he had taken from Betty, and in 
writing to her he took care not to dwell upon its mildness.&nbsp;
It was now that Betty began to pity him for what she had 
inflicted upon him by the kiss, and her correspondence acquired a
distinct flavour of kindness thenceforward.</p>
<p>Owing to his rebuffs, Reynard had grown to be truly in love 
with Betty in his mild, placid, durable way&mdash;in that way 
which perhaps, upon the whole, tends most generally to the 
woman&rsquo;s comfort under the institution of marriage, if not 
particularly to her ecstasy.&nbsp; Mrs. Dornell&rsquo;s 
exaggeration of her husband&rsquo;s wish for delay in their 
living together was inconvenient, but he would not openly 
infringe it.&nbsp; He wrote tenderly to Betty, and soon announced
that he had a little surprise in store for her.&nbsp; The secret 
was that the King had been graciously pleased to inform him 
privately, through a relation, that His Majesty was about to 
offer him a Barony.&nbsp; Would she like the title to be 
Ivell?&nbsp; Moreover, he had reason for knowing that in a few 
years the dignity would be raised to that of an Earl, for which 
creation he thought the title of Wessex would be eminently 
suitable, considering the position of much of their 
property.&nbsp; As Lady Ivell, therefore, and future Countess of 
Wessex, he should beg leave to offer her his heart a third 
time.</p>
<p>He did not add, as he might have added, how greatly the 
consideration of the enormous estates at King&rsquo;s-Hintock and
elsewhere which Betty would inherit, and her children after her, 
had conduced to this desirable honour.</p>
<p>Whether the impending titles had really any effect upon 
Betty&rsquo;s regard for him I cannot state, for she was one of 
those close characters who never let their minds be known upon 
anything.&nbsp; That such honour was absolutely unexpected by her
from such a quarter is, however, certain; and she could not deny 
that Stephen had shown her kindness, forbearance, even 
magnanimity; had forgiven her for an errant passion which he 
might with some reason have denounced, notwithstanding her cruel 
position as a child entrapped into marriage ere able to 
understand its bearings.</p>
<p>Her mother, in her grief and remorse for the loveless life she
had led with her rough, though open-hearted, husband, made now a 
creed of his merest whim; and continued to insist that, out of 
respect to his known desire, her son-in-law should not reside 
with Betty till the girl&rsquo;s father had been dead a year at 
least, at which time the girl would still be under 
nineteen.&nbsp; Letters must suffice for Stephen till then.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is rather long for him to wait,&rsquo; Betty 
hesitatingly said one day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; said her mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;From 
<i>you</i>? not to respect your dear father&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course it is quite proper,&rsquo; said Betty 
hastily.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t gainsay it.&nbsp; I was but 
thinking that&mdash;that&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the long slow months of the stipulated interval her mother 
tended and trained Betty carefully for her duties.&nbsp; Fully 
awake now to the many virtues of her dear departed one, she, 
among other acts of pious devotion to his memory, rebuilt the 
church of King&rsquo;s-Hintock village, and established valuable 
charities in all the villages of that name, as far as to 
Little-Hintock, several miles eastward.</p>
<p>In superintending these works, particularly that of the 
church-building, her daughter Betty was her constant companion, 
and the incidents of their execution were doubtless not without a
soothing effect upon the young creature&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; She 
had sprung from girl to woman by a sudden bound, and few would 
have recognized in the thoughtful face of Betty now the same 
person who, the year before, had seemed to have absolutely no 
idea whatever of responsibility, moral or other.&nbsp; Time 
passed thus till the Squire had been nearly a year in his vault; 
and Mrs. Dornell was duly asked by letter by the patient Reynard 
if she were willing for him to come soon.&nbsp; He did not wish 
to take Betty away if her mother&rsquo;s sense of loneliness 
would be too great, but would willingly live at 
King&rsquo;s-Hintock awhile with them.</p>
<p>Before the widow had replied to this communication, she one 
day happened to observe Betty walking on the south terrace in the
full sunlight, without hat or mantle, and was struck by her 
child&rsquo;s figure.&nbsp; Mrs. Dornell called her in, and said 
suddenly: &lsquo;Have you seen your husband since the time of 
your poor father&rsquo;s death?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;yes, mamma,&rsquo; says Betty, 
colouring.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;against my wishes and those of your dear 
father!&nbsp; I am shocked at your disobedience!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But my father said eighteen, ma&rsquo;am, and you made 
it much longer&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, of course&mdash;out of consideration for 
you!&nbsp; When have ye seen him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; stammered Betty, &lsquo;in the course of 
his letters to me he said that I belonged to him, and if nobody 
knew that we met it would make no difference.&nbsp; And that I 
need not hurt your feelings by telling you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I went to Casterbridge that time you went to London 
about five months ago&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And met him there?&nbsp; When did you come 
back?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear mamma, it grew very late, and he said it was safer
not to go back till next day, as the roads were bad; and as you 
were away from home&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear any more!&nbsp; This is your
respect for your father&rsquo;s memory,&rsquo; groaned the 
widow.&nbsp; &lsquo;When did you meet him again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh&mdash;not for more than a fortnight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A fortnight!&nbsp; How many times have ye seen him 
altogether?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure, mamma, I&rsquo;ve not seen him 
altogether a dozen times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A dozen!&nbsp; And eighteen and a half years old 
barely!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twice we met by accident,&rsquo; pleaded Betty.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Once at Abbot&rsquo;s-Cernel, and another time at the Red 
Lion, Melchester.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O thou deceitful girl!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Dornell.&nbsp;
&lsquo;An accident took you to the Red Lion whilst I was staying 
at the White Hart!&nbsp; I remember&mdash;you came in at twelve 
o&rsquo;clock at night and said you&rsquo;d been to see the 
cathedral by the light o&rsquo; the moon!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My ever-honoured mamma, so I had!&nbsp; I only went to 
the Red Lion with him afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh Betty, Betty!&nbsp; That my child should have 
deceived me even in my widowed days!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, my dearest mamma, you made me marry him!&rsquo; 
says Betty with spirit, &lsquo;and of course I&rsquo;ve to obey 
him more than you now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dornell sighed.&nbsp; &lsquo;All I have to say is, that 
you&rsquo;d better get your husband to join you as soon as 
possible,&rsquo; she remarked.&nbsp; &lsquo;To go on playing the 
maiden like this&mdash;I&rsquo;m ashamed to see you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She wrote instantly to Stephen Reynard: &lsquo;I wash my hands
of the whole matter as between you two; though I should advise 
you to <i>openly</i> join each other as soon as you can&mdash;if 
you wish to avoid scandal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He came, though not till the promised title had been granted, 
and he could call Betty archly &lsquo;My Lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>People said in after years that she and her husband were very 
happy.&nbsp; However that may be, they had a numerous family; and
she became in due course first Countess of Wessex, as he had 
foretold.</p>
<p>The little white frock in which she had been married to him at
the tender age of twelve was carefully preserved among the relics
at King&rsquo;s-Hintock Court, where it may still be seen by the 
curious&mdash;a yellowing, pathetic testimony to the small count 
taken of the happiness of an innocent child in the social 
strategy of those days, which might have led, but providentially 
did not lead, to great unhappiness.</p>
<p>When the Earl died Betty wrote him an epitaph, in which she 
described him as the best of husbands, fathers, and friends, and 
called herself his disconsolate widow.</p>
<p>Such is woman; or rather (not to give offence by so sweeping 
an assertion), such was Betty Dornell.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>It was at a meeting of one of the Wessex Field and Antiquarian
Clubs that the foregoing story, partly told, partly read from a 
manuscript, was made to do duty for the regulation papers on 
deformed butterflies, fossil ox-horns, prehistoric dung-mixens, 
and such like, that usually occupied the more serious attention 
of the members.</p>
<p>This Club was of an inclusive and intersocial character; to a 
degree, indeed, remarkable for the part of England in which it 
had its being&mdash;dear, delightful Wessex, whose statuesque 
dynasties are even now only just beginning to feel the shaking of
the new and strange spirit without, like that which entered the 
lonely valley of Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision and made the dry bones 
move: where the honest squires, tradesmen, parsons, clerks, and 
people still praise the Lord with one voice for His best of all 
possible worlds.</p>
<p>The present meeting, which was to extend over two days, had 
opened its proceedings at the museum of the town whose buildings 
and environs were to be visited by the members.&nbsp; Lunch had 
ended, and the afternoon excursion had been about to be 
undertaken, when the rain came down in an obstinate spatter, 
which revealed no sign of cessation.&nbsp; As the members waited 
they grew chilly, although it was only autumn, and a fire was 
lighted, which threw a cheerful shine upon the varnished skulls, 
urns, penates, tesser&aelig;, costumes, coats of mail, weapons, 
and missals, animated the fossilized ichthyosaurus and iguanodon;
while the dead eyes of the stuffed birds&mdash;those never-absent
familiars in such collections, though murdered to extinction out 
of doors&mdash;flashed as they had flashed to the rising sun 
above the neighbouring moors on the fatal morning when the 
trigger was pulled which ended their little flight.&nbsp; It was 
then that the historian produced his manuscript, which he had 
prepared, he said, with a view to publication.&nbsp; His delivery
of the story having concluded as aforesaid, the speaker expressed
his hope that the constraint of the weather, and the paucity of 
more scientific papers, would excuse any inappropriateness in his
subject.</p>
<p>Several members observed that a storm-bound club could not 
presume to be selective, and they were all very much obliged to 
him for such a curious chapter from the domestic histories of the
county.</p>
<p>The President looked gloomily from the window at the 
descending rain, and broke a short silence by saying that though 
the Club had met, there seemed little probability of its being 
able to visit the objects of interest set down among the 
<i>agenda</i>.</p>
<p>The Treasurer observed that they had at least a roof over 
their heads; and they had also a second day before them.</p>
<p>A sentimental member, leaning back in his chair, declared that
he was in no hurry to go out, and that nothing would please him 
so much as another county story, with or without manuscript.</p>
<p>The Colonel added that the subject should be a lady, like the 
former, to which a gentleman known as the Spark said &lsquo;Hear,
hear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though these had spoken in jest, a rural dean who was present 
observed blandly that there was no lack of materials.&nbsp; Many,
indeed, were the legends and traditions of gentle and noble 
dames, renowned in times past in that part of England, whose 
actions and passions were now, but for men&rsquo;s memories, 
buried under the brief inscription on a tomb or an entry of dates
in a dry pedigree.</p>
<p>Another member, an old surgeon, a somewhat grim though 
sociable personage, was quite of the speaker&rsquo;s opinion, and
felt quite sure that the memory of the reverend gentleman must 
abound with such curious tales of fair dames, of their loves and 
hates, their joys and their misfortunes, their beauty and their 
fate.</p>
<p>The parson, a trifle confused, retorted that their friend the 
surgeon, the son of a surgeon, seemed to him, as a man who had 
seen much and heard more during the long course of his own and 
his father&rsquo;s practice, the member of all others most likely
to be acquainted with such lore.</p>
<p>The bookworm, the Colonel, the historian, the Vice-president, 
the churchwarden, the two curates, the gentleman-tradesman, the 
sentimental member, the crimson maltster, the quiet gentleman, 
the man of family, the Spark, and several others, quite agreed, 
and begged that he would recall something of the kind.&nbsp; The 
old surgeon said that, though a meeting of the Mid-Wessex Field 
and Antiquarian Club was the last place at which he should have 
expected to be called upon in this way, he had no objection; and 
the parson said he would come next.&nbsp; The surgeon then 
reflected, and decided to relate the history of a lady named 
Barbara, who lived towards the end of the last century, 
apologizing for his tale as being perhaps a little too 
professional.&nbsp; The crimson maltster winked to the Spark at 
hearing the nature of the apology, and the surgeon began.</p>
<h2>DAME THE SECOND&mdash;BARBARA OF THE HOUSE OF GREBE<br />
By the Old Surgeon</h2>
<p>It was apparently an idea, rather than a passion, that 
inspired Lord Uplandtowers&rsquo; resolve to win her.&nbsp; 
Nobody ever knew when he formed it, or whence he got his 
assurance of success in the face of her manifest dislike of 
him.&nbsp; Possibly not until after that first important act of 
her life which I shall presently mention.&nbsp; His matured and 
cynical doggedness at the age of nineteen, when impulse mostly 
rules calculation, was remarkable, and might have owed its 
existence as much to his succession to the earldom and its 
accompanying local honours in childhood, as to the family 
character; an elevation which jerked him into maturity, so to 
speak, without his having known adolescence.&nbsp; He had only 
reached his twelfth year when his father, the fourth Earl, died, 
after a course of the Bath waters.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the family character had a great deal to do with
it.&nbsp; Determination was hereditary in the bearers of that 
escutcheon; sometimes for good, sometimes for evil.</p>
<p>The seats of the two families were about ten miles apart, the 
way between them lying along the now old, then new, turnpike-road
connecting Havenpool and Warborne with the city of Melchester: a 
road which, though only a branch from what was known as the Great
Western Highway, is probably, even at present, as it has been for
the last hundred years, one of the finest examples of a 
macadamized turnpike-track that can be found in England.</p>
<p>The mansion of the Earl, as well as that of his neighbour, 
Barbara&rsquo;s father, stood back about a mile from the highway,
with which each was connected by an ordinary drive and 
lodge.&nbsp; It was along this particular highway that the young 
Earl drove on a certain evening at Christmastide some twenty 
years before the end of the last century, to attend a ball at 
Chene Manor, the home of Barbara, and her parents Sir John and 
Lady Grebe.&nbsp; Sir John&rsquo;s was a baronetcy created a few 
years before the breaking out of the Civil War, and his lands 
were even more extensive than those of Lord Uplandtowers himself;
comprising this Manor of Chene, another on the coast near, half 
the Hundred of Cockdene, and well-enclosed lands in several other
parishes, notably Warborne and those contiguous.&nbsp; At this 
time Barbara was barely seventeen, and the ball is the first 
occasion on which we have any tradition of Lord Uplandtowers 
attempting tender relations with her; it was early enough, God 
knows.</p>
<p>An intimate friend&mdash;one of the Drenkhards&mdash;is said 
to have dined with him that day, and Lord Uplandtowers had, for a
wonder, communicated to his guest the secret design of his 
heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll never get her&mdash;sure; you&rsquo;ll 
never get her!&rsquo; this friend had said at parting.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;She&rsquo;s not drawn to your lordship by love: and as for
thought of a good match, why, there&rsquo;s no more calculation 
in her than in a bird.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rsquo; said Lord Uplandtowers 
impassively.</p>
<p>He no doubt thought of his friend&rsquo;s forecast as he 
travelled along the highway in his chariot; but the sculptural 
repose of his profile against the vanishing daylight on his right
hand would have shown his friend that the Earl&rsquo;s equanimity
was undisturbed.&nbsp; He reached the solitary wayside tavern 
called Lornton Inn&mdash;the rendezvous of many a daring poacher 
for operations in the adjoining forest; and he might have 
observed, if he had taken the trouble, a strange post-chaise 
standing in the halting-space before the inn.&nbsp; He duly sped 
past it, and half-an-hour after through the little town of 
Warborne.&nbsp; Onward, a mile farther, was the house of his 
entertainer.</p>
<p>At this date it was an imposing edifice&mdash;or, rather, 
congeries of edifices&mdash;as extensive as the residence of the 
Earl himself; though far less regular.&nbsp; One wing showed 
extreme antiquity, having huge chimneys, whose substructures 
projected from the external walls like towers; and a kitchen of 
vast dimensions, in which (it was said) breakfasts had been 
cooked for John of Gaunt.&nbsp; Whilst he was yet in the 
forecourt he could hear the rhythm of French horns and 
clarionets, the favourite instruments of those days at such 
entertainments.</p>
<p>Entering the long parlour, in which the dance had just been 
opened by Lady Grebe with a minuet&mdash;it being now seven 
o&rsquo;clock, according to the tradition&mdash;he was received 
with a welcome befitting his rank, and looked round for 
Barbara.&nbsp; She was not dancing, and seemed to be 
preoccupied&mdash;almost, indeed, as though she had been waiting 
for him.&nbsp; Barbara at this time was a good and pretty girl, 
who never spoke ill of any one, and hated other pretty women the 
very least possible.&nbsp; She did not refuse him for the 
country-dance which followed, and soon after was his partner in a
second.</p>
<p>The evening wore on, and the horns and clarionets tootled 
merrily.&nbsp; Barbara evinced towards her lover neither distinct
preference nor aversion; but old eyes would have seen that she 
pondered something.&nbsp; However, after supper she pleaded a 
headache, and disappeared.&nbsp; To pass the time of her absence,
Lord Uplandtowers went into a little room adjoining the long 
gallery, where some elderly ones were sitting by the 
fire&mdash;for he had a phlegmatic dislike of dancing for its own
sake,&mdash;and, lifting the window-curtains, he looked out of 
the window into the park and wood, dark now as a cavern.&nbsp; 
Some of the guests appeared to be leaving even so soon as this, 
two lights showing themselves as turning away from the door and 
sinking to nothing in the distance.</p>
<p>His hostess put her head into the room to look for partners 
for the ladies, and Lord Uplandtowers came out.&nbsp; Lady Grebe 
informed him that Barbara had not returned to the ball-room: she 
had gone to bed in sheer necessity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has been so excited over the ball all day,&rsquo; 
her mother continued, &lsquo;that I feared she would be worn out 
early . . . But sure, Lord Uplandtowers, you won&rsquo;t be 
leaving yet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said that it was near twelve o&rsquo;clock, and that some 
had already left.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I protest nobody has gone yet,&rsquo; said Lady 
Grebe.</p>
<p>To humour her he stayed till midnight, and then set out.&nbsp;
He had made no progress in his suit; but he had assured himself 
that Barbara gave no other guest the preference, and nearly 
everybody in the neighbourhood was there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis only a matter of time,&rsquo; said the calm 
young philosopher.</p>
<p>The next morning he lay till near ten o&rsquo;clock, and he 
had only just come out upon the head of the staircase when he 
heard hoofs upon the gravel without; in a few moments the door 
had been opened, and Sir John Grebe met him in the hall, as he 
set foot on the lowest stair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lord&mdash;where&rsquo;s Barbara&mdash;my 
daughter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Even the Earl of Uplandtowers could not repress 
amazement.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, my dear Sir 
John,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>The news was startling, indeed.&nbsp; From the Baronet&rsquo;s
disjointed explanation Lord Uplandtowers gathered that after his 
own and the other guests&rsquo; departure Sir John and Lady Grebe
had gone to rest without seeing any more of Barbara; it being 
understood by them that she had retired to bed when she sent word
to say that she could not join the dancers again.&nbsp; Before 
then she had told her maid that she would dispense with her 
services for this night; and there was evidence to show that the 
young lady had never lain down at all, the bed remaining 
unpressed.&nbsp; Circumstances seemed to prove that the deceitful
girl had feigned indisposition to get an excuse for leaving the 
ball-room, and that she had left the house within ten minutes, 
presumably during the first dance after supper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw her go,&rsquo; said Lord Uplandtowers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The devil you did!&rsquo; says Sir John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he mentioned the retreating 
carriage-lights, and how he was assured by Lady Grebe that no 
guest had departed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely that was it!&rsquo; said the father.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;But she&rsquo;s not gone alone, d&rsquo;ye 
know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;who is the young man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can on&rsquo;y guess.&nbsp; My worst fear is my most 
likely guess.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll say no more.&nbsp; I 
thought&mdash;yet I would not believe&mdash;it possible that you 
was the sinner.&nbsp; Would that you had been!&nbsp; But 
&rsquo;tis t&rsquo;other, &rsquo;tis t&rsquo;other, by 
G---!&nbsp; I must e&rsquo;en up, and after &rsquo;em!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whom do you suspect?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir John would not give a name, and, stultified rather than 
agitated, Lord Uplandtowers accompanied him back to Chene.&nbsp; 
He again asked upon whom were the Baronet&rsquo;s suspicions 
directed; and the impulsive Sir John was no match for the 
insistence of Uplandtowers.</p>
<p>He said at length, &lsquo;I fear &rsquo;tis Edmond 
Willowes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A young fellow of Shottsford-Forum&mdash;a 
widow-woman&rsquo;s son,&rsquo; the other told him, and explained
that Willowes&rsquo;s father, or grandfather, was the last of the
old glass-painters in that place, where (as you may know) the art
lingered on when it had died out in every other part of 
England.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By G--- that&rsquo;s bad&mdash;mighty bad!&rsquo; said 
Lord Uplandtowers, throwing himself back in the chaise in frigid 
despair.</p>
<p>They despatched emissaries in all directions; one by the 
Melchester Road, another by Shottsford-Forum, another 
coastwards.</p>
<p>But the lovers had a ten-hours&rsquo; start; and it was 
apparent that sound judgment had been exercised in choosing as 
their time of flight the particular night when the movements of a
strange carriage would not be noticed, either in the park or on 
the neighbouring highway, owing to the general press of 
vehicles.&nbsp; The chaise which had been seen waiting at Lornton
Inn was, no doubt, the one they had escaped in; and the pair of 
heads which had planned so cleverly thus far had probably 
contrived marriage ere now.</p>
<p>The fears of her parents were realized.&nbsp; A letter sent by
special messenger from Barbara, on the evening of that day, 
briefly informed them that her lover and herself were on the way 
to London, and before this communication reached her home they 
would be united as husband and wife.&nbsp; She had taken this 
extreme step because she loved her dear Edmond as she could love 
no other man, and because she had seen closing round her the doom
of marriage with Lord Uplandtowers, unless she put that 
threatened fate out of possibility by doing as she had 
done.&nbsp; She had well considered the step beforehand, and was 
prepared to live like any other country-townsman&rsquo;s wife if 
her father repudiated her for her action.</p>
<p>&lsquo;D--- her!&rsquo; said Lord Uplandtowers, as he drove 
homeward that night.&nbsp; &lsquo;D--- her for a 
fool!&rsquo;&mdash;which shows the kind of love he bore her.</p>
<p>Well; Sir John had already started in pursuit of them as a 
matter of duty, driving like a wild man to Melchester, and thence
by the direct highway to the capital.&nbsp; But he soon saw that 
he was acting to no purpose; and by and by, discovering that the 
marriage had actually taken place, he forebore all attempts to 
unearth them in the City, and returned and sat down with his lady
to digest the event as best they could.</p>
<p>To proceed against this Willowes for the abduction of our 
heiress was, possibly, in their power; yet, when they considered 
the now unalterable facts, they refrained from violent 
retribution.&nbsp; Some six weeks passed, during which time 
Barbara&rsquo;s parents, though they keenly felt her loss, held 
no communication with the truant, either for reproach or 
condonation.&nbsp; They continued to think of the disgrace she 
had brought upon herself; for, though the young man was an honest
fellow, and the son of an honest father, the latter had died so 
early, and his widow had had such struggles to maintain herself; 
that the son was very imperfectly educated.&nbsp; Moreover, his 
blood was, as far as they knew, of no distinction whatever, 
whilst hers, through her mother, was compounded of the best 
juices of ancient baronial distillation, containing tinctures of 
Maundeville, and Mohun, and Syward, and Peverell, and Culliford, 
and Talbot, and Plantagenet, and York, and Lancaster, and God 
knows what besides, which it was a thousand pities to throw 
away.</p>
<p>The father and mother sat by the fireplace that was spanned by
the four-centred arch bearing the family shields on its haunches,
and groaned aloud&mdash;the lady more than Sir John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To think this should have come upon us in our old 
age!&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speak for yourself!&rsquo; she snapped through her 
sobs.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am only one-and-forty! . . . Why 
didn&rsquo;t ye ride faster and overtake &rsquo;em!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime the young married lovers, caring no more about
their blood than about ditch-water, were intensely 
happy&mdash;happy, that is, in the descending scale which, as we 
all know, Heaven in its wisdom has ordained for such rash cases; 
that is to say, the first week they were in the seventh heaven, 
the second in the sixth, the third week temperate, the fourth 
reflective, and so on; a lover&rsquo;s heart after possession 
being comparable to the earth in its geologic stages, as 
described to us sometimes by our worthy President; first a hot 
coal, then a warm one, then a cooling cinder, then 
chilly&mdash;the simile shall be pursued no further.&nbsp; The 
long and the short of it was that one day a letter, sealed with 
their daughter&rsquo;s own little seal, came into Sir John and 
Lady Grebe&rsquo;s hands; and, on opening it, they found it to 
contain an appeal from the young couple to Sir John to forgive 
them for what they had done, and they would fall on their naked 
knees and be most dutiful children for evermore.</p>
<p>Then Sir John and his lady sat down again by the fireplace 
with the four-centred arch, and consulted, and re-read the 
letter.&nbsp; Sir John Grebe, if the truth must be told, loved 
his daughter&rsquo;s happiness far more, poor man, than he loved 
his name and lineage; he recalled to his mind all her little 
ways, gave vent to a sigh; and, by this time acclimatized to the 
idea of the marriage, said that what was done could not be 
undone, and that he supposed they must not be too harsh with 
her.&nbsp; Perhaps Barbara and her husband were in actual need; 
and how could they let their only child starve?</p>
<p>A slight consolation had come to them in an unexpected 
manner.&nbsp; They had been credibly informed that an ancestor of
plebeian Willowes was once honoured with intermarriage with a 
scion of the aristocracy who had gone to the dogs.&nbsp; In 
short, such is the foolishness of distinguished parents, and 
sometimes of others also, that they wrote that very day to the 
address Barbara had given them, informing her that she might 
return home and bring her husband with her; they would not object
to see him, would not reproach her, and would endeavour to 
welcome both, and to discuss with them what could best be 
arranged for their future.</p>
<p>In three or four days a rather shabby post-chaise drew up at 
the door of Chene Manor-house, at sound of which the 
tender-hearted baronet and his wife ran out as if to welcome a 
prince and princess of the blood.&nbsp; They were overjoyed to 
see their spoilt child return safe and sound&mdash;though she was
only Mrs. Willowes, wife of Edmond Willowes of nowhere.&nbsp; 
Barbara burst into penitential tears, and both husband and wife 
were contrite enough, as well they might be, considering that 
they had not a guinea to call their own.</p>
<p>When the four had calmed themselves, and not a word of chiding
had been uttered to the pair, they discussed the position 
soberly, young Willowes sitting in the background with great 
modesty till invited forward by Lady Grebe in no frigid tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How handsome he is!&rsquo; she said to herself.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at Barbara&rsquo;s craze for 
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was, indeed, one of the handsomest men who ever set his 
lips on a maid&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A blue coat, murrey waistcoat, and 
breeches of drab set off a figure that could scarcely be 
surpassed.&nbsp; He had large dark eyes, anxious now, as they 
glanced from Barbara to her parents and tenderly back again to 
her; observing whom, even now in her trepidation, one could see 
why the <i>sang froid</i> of Lord Uplandtowers had been raised to
more than lukewarmness.&nbsp; Her fair young face (according to 
the tale handed down by old women) looked out from under a gray 
conical hat, trimmed with white ostrich-feathers, and her little 
toes peeped from a buff petticoat worn under a puce gown.&nbsp; 
Her features were not regular: they were almost infantine, as you
may see from miniatures in possession of the family, her mouth 
showing much sensitiveness, and one could be sure that her faults
would not lie on the side of bad temper unless for urgent 
reasons.</p>
<p>Well, they discussed their state as became them, and the 
desire of the young couple to gain the goodwill of those upon 
whom they were literally dependent for everything induced them to
agree to any temporizing measure that was not too irksome.&nbsp; 
Therefore, having been nearly two months united, they did not 
oppose Sir John&rsquo;s proposal that he should furnish Edmond 
Willowes with funds sufficient for him to travel a year on the 
Continent in the company of a tutor, the young man undertaking to
lend himself with the utmost diligence to the tutor&rsquo;s 
instructions, till he became polished outwardly and inwardly to 
the degree required in the husband of such a lady as 
Barbara.&nbsp; He was to apply himself to the study of languages,
manners, history, society, ruins, and everything else that came 
under his eyes, till he should return to take his place without 
blushing by Barbara&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And by that time,&rsquo; said worthy Sir John, 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get my little place out at Yewsholt ready for 
you and Barbara to occupy on your return.&nbsp; The house is 
small and out of the way; but it will do for a young couple for a
while.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If &rsquo;twere no bigger than a summer-house it would 
do!&rsquo; says Barbara.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If &rsquo;twere no bigger than a sedan-chair!&rsquo; 
says Willowes.&nbsp; &lsquo;And the more lonely the 
better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can put up with the loneliness,&rsquo; said Barbara,
with less zest.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some friends will come, no 
doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All this being laid down, a travelled tutor was called 
in&mdash;a man of many gifts and great experience,&mdash;and on a
fine morning away tutor and pupil went.&nbsp; A great reason 
urged against Barbara accompanying her youthful husband was that 
his attentions to her would naturally be such as to prevent his 
zealously applying every hour of his time to learning and 
seeing&mdash;an argument of wise prescience, and 
unanswerable.&nbsp; Regular days for letter-writing were fixed, 
Barbara and her Edmond exchanged their last kisses at the door, 
and the chaise swept under the archway into the drive.</p>
<p>He wrote to her from Le Havre, as soon as he reached that 
port, which was not for seven days, on account of adverse winds; 
he wrote from Rouen, and from Paris; described to her his sight 
of the King and Court at Versailles, and the wonderful 
marble-work and mirrors in that palace; wrote next from Lyons; 
then, after a comparatively long interval, from Turin, narrating 
his fearful adventures in crossing Mont Cenis on mules, and how 
he was overtaken with a terrific snowstorm, which had well-nigh 
been the end of him, and his tutor, and his guides.&nbsp; Then he
wrote glowingly of Italy; and Barbara could see the development 
of her husband&rsquo;s mind reflected in his letters month by 
month; and she much admired the forethought of her father in 
suggesting this education for Edmond.&nbsp; Yet she sighed 
sometimes&mdash;her husband being no longer in evidence to 
fortify her in her choice of him&mdash;and timidly dreaded what 
mortifications might be in store for her by reason of this 
<i>m&eacute;salliance</i>.&nbsp; She went out very little; for on
the one or two occasions on which she had shown herself to former
friends she noticed a distinct difference in their manner, as 
though they should say, &lsquo;Ah, my happy swain&rsquo;s wife; 
you&rsquo;re caught!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Edmond&rsquo;s letters were as affectionate as ever; even more
affectionate, after a while, than hers were to him.&nbsp; Barbara
observed this growing coolness in herself; and like a good and 
honest lady was horrified and grieved, since her only wish was to
act faithfully and uprightly.&nbsp; It troubled her so much that 
she prayed for a warmer heart, and at last wrote to her husband 
to beg him, now that he was in the land of Art, to send her his 
portrait, ever so small, that she might look at it all day and 
every day, and never for a moment forget his features.</p>
<p>Willowes was nothing loth, and replied that he would do more 
than she wished: he had made friends with a sculptor in Pisa, who
was much interested in him and his history; and he had 
commissioned this artist to make a bust of himself in marble, 
which when finished he would send her.&nbsp; What Barbara had 
wanted was something immediate; but she expressed no objection to
the delay; and in his next communication Edmund told her that the
sculptor, of his own choice, had decided to increase the bust to 
a full-length statue, so anxious was he to get a specimen of his 
skill introduced to the notice of the English aristocracy.&nbsp; 
It was progressing well, and rapidly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Barbara&rsquo;s attention began to be occupied at 
home with Yewsholt Lodge, the house that her kind-hearted father 
was preparing for her residence when her husband returned.&nbsp; 
It was a small place on the plan of a large one&mdash;a cottage 
built in the form of a mansion, having a central hall with a 
wooden gallery running round it, and rooms no bigger than closets
to follow this introduction.&nbsp; It stood on a slope so 
solitary, and surrounded by trees so dense, that the birds who 
inhabited the boughs sang at strange hours, as if they hardly 
could distinguish night from day.</p>
<p>During the progress of repairs at this bower Barbara 
frequently visited it.&nbsp; Though so secluded by the dense 
growth, it was near the high road, and one day while looking over
the fence she saw Lord Uplandtowers riding past.&nbsp; He saluted
her courteously, yet with mechanical stiffness, and did not 
halt.&nbsp; Barbara went home, and continued to pray that she 
might never cease to love her husband.&nbsp; After that she 
sickened, and did not come out of doors again for a long 
time.</p>
<p>The year of education had extended to fourteen months, and the
house was in order for Edmond&rsquo;s return to take up his abode
there with Barbara, when, instead of the accustomed letter for 
her, came one to Sir John Grebe in the handwriting of the said 
tutor, informing him of a terrible catastrophe that had occurred 
to them at Venice.&nbsp; Mr Willowes and himself had attended the
theatre one night during the Carnival of the preceding week, to 
witness the Italian comedy, when, owing to the carelessness of 
one of the candle-snuffers, the theatre had caught fire, and been
burnt to the ground.&nbsp; Few persons had lost their lives, 
owing to the superhuman exertions of some of the audience in 
getting out the senseless sufferers; and, among them all, he who 
had risked his own life the most heroically was Mr. 
Willowes.&nbsp; In re-entering for the fifth time to save his 
fellow-creatures some fiery beams had fallen upon him, and he had
been given up for lost.&nbsp; He was, however, by the blessing of
Providence, recovered, with the life still in him, though he was 
fearfully burnt; and by almost a miracle he seemed likely to 
survive, his constitution being wondrously sound.&nbsp; He was, 
of course, unable to write, but he was receiving the attention of
several skilful surgeons.&nbsp; Further report would be made by 
the next mail or by private hand.</p>
<p>The tutor said nothing in detail of poor Willowes&rsquo;s 
sufferings, but as soon as the news was broken to Barbara she 
realized how intense they must have been, and her immediate 
instinct was to rush to his side, though, on consideration, the 
journey seemed impossible to her.&nbsp; Her health was by no 
means what it had been, and to post across Europe at that season 
of the year, or to traverse the Bay of Biscay in a sailing-craft,
was an undertaking that would hardly be justified by the 
result.&nbsp; But she was anxious to go till, on reading to the 
end of the letter, her husband&rsquo;s tutor was found to hint 
very strongly against such a step if it should be contemplated, 
this being also the opinion of the surgeons.&nbsp; And though 
Willowes&rsquo;s comrade refrained from giving his reasons, they 
disclosed themselves plainly enough in the sequel.</p>
<p>The truth was that the worst of the wounds resulting from the 
fire had occurred to his head and face&mdash;that handsome face 
which had won her heart from her,&mdash;and both the tutor and 
the surgeons knew that for a sensitive young woman to see him 
before his wounds had healed would cause more misery to her by 
the shock than happiness to him by her ministrations.</p>
<p>Lady Grebe blurted out what Sir John and Barbara had thought, 
but had had too much delicacy to express.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sure, &rsquo;tis mighty hard for you, poor Barbara, 
that the one little gift he had to justify your rash choice of 
him&mdash;his wonderful good looks&mdash;should be taken away 
like this, to leave &rsquo;ee no excuse at all for your conduct 
in the world&rsquo;s eyes . . . Well, I wish you&rsquo;d married 
t&rsquo;other&mdash;that do I!&rsquo;&nbsp; And the lady 
sighed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll soon get right again,&rsquo; said her 
father soothingly.</p>
<p>Such remarks as the above were not often made; but they were 
frequent enough to cause Barbara an uneasy sense of 
self-stultification.&nbsp; She determined to hear them no longer;
and the house at Yewsholt being ready and furnished, she withdrew
thither with her maids, where for the first time she could feel 
mistress of a home that would be hers and her husband&rsquo;s 
exclusively, when he came.</p>
<p>After long weeks Willowes had recovered sufficiently to be 
able to write himself; and slowly and tenderly he enlightened her
upon the full extent of his injuries.&nbsp; It was a mercy, he 
said, that he had not lost his sight entirely; but he was 
thankful to say that he still retained full vision in one eye, 
though the other was dark for ever.&nbsp; The sparing manner in 
which he meted out particulars of his condition told Barbara how 
appalling had been his experience.&nbsp; He was grateful for her 
assurance that nothing could change her; but feared she did not 
fully realize that he was so sadly disfigured as to make it 
doubtful if she would recognize him.&nbsp; However, in spite of 
all, his heart was as true to her as it ever had been.</p>
<p>Barbara saw from his anxiety how much lay behind.&nbsp; She 
replied that she submitted to the decrees of Fate, and would 
welcome him in any shape as soon as he could come.&nbsp; She told
him of the pretty retreat in which she had taken up her abode, 
pending their joint occupation of it, and did not reveal how much
she had sighed over the information that all his good looks were 
gone.&nbsp; Still less did she say that she felt a certain 
strangeness in awaiting him, the weeks they had lived together 
having been so short by comparison with the length of his 
absence.</p>
<p>Slowly drew on the time when Willowes found himself well 
enough to come home.&nbsp; He landed at Southampton, and posted 
thence towards Yewsholt.&nbsp; Barbara arranged to go out to meet
him as far as Lornton Inn&mdash;the spot between the Forest and 
the Chase at which he had waited for night on the evening of 
their elopement.&nbsp; Thither she drove at the appointed hour in
a little pony-chaise, presented her by her father on her birthday
for her especial use in her new house; which vehicle she sent 
back on arriving at the inn, the plan agreed upon being that she 
should perform the return journey with her husband in his hired 
coach.</p>
<p>There was not much accommodation for a lady at this wayside 
tavern; but, as it was a fine evening in early summer, she did 
not mind&mdash;walking about outside, and straining her eyes 
along the highway for the expected one.&nbsp; But each cloud of 
dust that enlarged in the distance and drew near was found to 
disclose a conveyance other than his post-chaise.&nbsp; Barbara 
remained till the appointment was two hours passed, and then 
began to fear that owing to some adverse wind in the Channel he 
was not coming that night.</p>
<p>While waiting she was conscious of a curious trepidation that 
was not entirely solicitude, and did not amount to dread; her 
tense state of incertitude bordered both on disappointment and on
relief.&nbsp; She had lived six or seven weeks with an 
imperfectly educated yet handsome husband whom now she had not 
seen for seventeen months, and who was so changed physically by 
an accident that she was assured she would hardly know him.&nbsp;
Can we wonder at her compound state of mind?</p>
<p>But her immediate difficulty was to get away from Lornton Inn,
for her situation was becoming embarrassing.&nbsp; Like too many 
of Barbara&rsquo;s actions, this drive had been undertaken 
without much reflection.&nbsp; Expecting to wait no more than a 
few minutes for her husband in his post-chaise, and to enter it 
with him, she had not hesitated to isolate herself by sending 
back her own little vehicle.&nbsp; She now found that, being so 
well known in this neighbourhood, her excursion to meet her 
long-absent husband was exciting great interest.&nbsp; She was 
conscious that more eyes were watching her from the inn-windows 
than met her own gaze.&nbsp; Barbara had decided to get home by 
hiring whatever kind of conveyance the tavern afforded, when, 
straining her eyes for the last time over the now darkening 
highway, she perceived yet another dust-cloud drawing near.&nbsp;
She paused; a chariot ascended to the inn, and would have passed 
had not its occupant caught sight of her standing 
expectantly.&nbsp; The horses were checked on the instant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You here&mdash;and alone, my dear Mrs. Willowes?&rsquo;
said Lord Uplandtowers, whose carriage it was.</p>
<p>She explained what had brought her into this lonely situation;
and, as he was going in the direction of her own home, she 
accepted his offer of a seat beside him.&nbsp; Their conversation
was embarrassed and fragmentary at first; but when they had 
driven a mile or two she was surprised to find herself talking 
earnestly and warmly to him: her impulsiveness was in truth but 
the natural consequence of her late existence&mdash;a somewhat 
desolate one by reason of the strange marriage she had made; and 
there is no more indiscreet mood than that of a woman surprised 
into talk who has long been imposing upon herself a policy of 
reserve.&nbsp; Therefore her ingenuous heart rose with a bound 
into her throat when, in response to his leading questions, or 
rather hints, she allowed her troubles to leak out of her.&nbsp; 
Lord Uplandtowers took her quite to her own door, although he had
driven three miles out of his way to do so; and in handing her 
down she heard from him a whisper of stern reproach: &lsquo;It 
need not have been thus if you had listened to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She made no reply, and went indoors.&nbsp; There, as the 
evening wore away, she regretted more and more that she had been 
so friendly with Lord Uplandtowers.&nbsp; But he had launched 
himself upon her so unexpectedly: if she had only foreseen the 
meeting with him, what a careful line of conduct she would have 
marked out!&nbsp; Barbara broke into a perspiration of disquiet 
when she thought of her unreserve, and, in self-chastisement, 
resolved to sit up till midnight on the bare chance of 
Edmond&rsquo;s return; directing that supper should be laid for 
him, improbable as his arrival till the morrow was.</p>
<p>The hours went past, and there was dead silence in and round 
about Yewsholt Lodge, except for the soughing of the trees; till,
when it was near upon midnight, she heard the noise of hoofs and 
wheels approaching the door.&nbsp; Knowing that it could only be 
her husband, Barbara instantly went into the hall to meet 
him.&nbsp; Yet she stood there not without a sensation of 
faintness, so many were the changes since their parting!&nbsp; 
And, owing to her casual encounter with Lord Uplandtowers, his 
voice and image still remained with her, excluding Edmond, her 
husband, from the inner circle of her impressions.</p>
<p>But she went to the door, and the next moment a figure stepped
inside, of which she knew the outline, but little besides.&nbsp; 
Her husband was attired in a flapping black cloak and slouched 
hat, appearing altogether as a foreigner, and not as the young 
English burgess who had left her side.&nbsp; When he came forward
into the light of the lamp, she perceived with surprise, and 
almost with fright, that he wore a mask.&nbsp; At first she had 
not noticed this&mdash;there being nothing in its colour which 
would lead a casual observer to think he was looking on anything 
but a real countenance.</p>
<p>He must have seen her start of dismay at the unexpectedness of
his appearance, for he said hastily: &lsquo;I did not mean to 
come in to you like this&mdash;I thought you would have been in 
bed.&nbsp; How good you are, dear Barbara!&rsquo;&nbsp; He put 
his arm round her, but he did not attempt to kiss her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Edmond&mdash;it <i>is</i> you?&mdash;it must 
be?&rsquo; she said, with clasped hands, for though his figure 
and movement were almost enough to prove it, and the tones were 
not unlike the old tones, the enunciation was so altered as to 
seem that of a stranger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am covered like this to hide myself from the curious 
eyes of the inn-servants and others,&rsquo; he said, in a low 
voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will send back the carriage and join you in
a moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are quite alone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite.&nbsp; My companion stopped at 
Southampton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The wheels of the post-chaise rolled away as she entered the 
dining-room, where the supper was spread; and presently he 
rejoined her there.&nbsp; He had removed his cloak and hat, but 
the mask was still retained; and she could now see that it was of
special make, of some flexible material like silk, coloured so as
to represent flesh; it joined naturally to the front hair, and 
was otherwise cleverly executed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Barbara&mdash;you look ill,&rsquo; he said, removing 
his glove, and taking her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;I have been ill,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this pretty little house ours?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; She was hardly conscious of 
her words, for the hand he had ungloved in order to take hers was
contorted, and had one or two of its fingers missing; while 
through the mask she discerned the twinkle of one eye only.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would give anything to kiss you, dearest, now, at 
this moment!&rsquo; he continued, with mournful 
passionateness.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I cannot&mdash;in this 
guise.&nbsp; The servants are abed, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I can call 
them?&nbsp; You will have some supper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said he would have some, but that it was not necessary to 
call anybody at that hour.&nbsp; Thereupon they approached the 
table, and sat down, facing each other.</p>
<p>Despite Barbara&rsquo;s scared state of mind, it was forced 
upon her notice that her husband trembled, as if he feared the 
impression he was producing, or was about to produce, as much as,
or more than, she.&nbsp; He drew nearer, and took her hand 
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had this mask made at Venice,&rsquo; he began, in 
evident embarrassment.&nbsp; &lsquo;My darling Barbara&mdash;my 
dearest wife&mdash;do you think you&mdash;will mind when I take 
it off?&nbsp; You will not dislike me&mdash;will you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Edmond, of course I shall not mind,&rsquo; said 
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;What has happened to you is our misfortune; but
I am prepared for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you sure you are prepared?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes!&nbsp; You are my husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You really feel quite confident that nothing external 
can affect you?&rsquo; he said again, in a voice rendered 
uncertain by his agitation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I am&mdash;quite,&rsquo; she answered 
faintly.</p>
<p>He bent his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope, I hope you are,&rsquo; 
he whispered.</p>
<p>In the pause which followed, the ticking of the clock in the 
hall seemed to grow loud; and he turned a little aside to remove 
the mask.&nbsp; She breathlessly awaited the operation, which was
one of some tediousness, watching him one moment, averting her 
face the next; and when it was done she shut her eyes at the 
hideous spectacle that was revealed.&nbsp; A quick spasm of 
horror had passed through her; but though she quailed she forced 
herself to regard him anew, repressing the cry that would 
naturally have escaped from her ashy lips.&nbsp; Unable to look 
at him longer, Barbara sank down on the floor beside her chair, 
covering her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You cannot look at me!&rsquo; he groaned in a hopeless 
way.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am too terrible an object even for you to 
bear!&nbsp; I knew it; yet I hoped against it.&nbsp; Oh, this is 
a bitter fate&mdash;curse the skill of those Venetian surgeons 
who saved me alive! . . . Look up, Barbara,&rsquo; he continued 
beseechingly; &lsquo;view me completely; say you loathe me, if 
you do loathe me, and settle the case between us for 
ever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>His unhappy wife pulled herself together for a desperate 
strain.&nbsp; He was her Edmond; he had done her no wrong; he had
suffered.&nbsp; A momentary devotion to him helped her, and 
lifting her eyes as bidden she regarded this human remnant, this 
<i>&eacute;corch&eacute;</i>, a second time.&nbsp; But the sight 
was too much.&nbsp; She again involuntarily looked aside and 
shuddered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think you can get used to this?&rsquo; he 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes or no!&nbsp; Can you bear such a thing of 
the charnel-house near you?&nbsp; Judge for yourself; 
Barbara.&nbsp; Your Adonis, your matchless man, has come to 
this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The poor lady stood beside him motionless, save for the 
restlessness of her eyes.&nbsp; All her natural sentiments of 
affection and pity were driven clean out of her by a sort of 
panic; she had just the same sense of dismay and fearfulness that
she would have had in the presence of an apparition.&nbsp; She 
could nohow fancy this to be her chosen one&mdash;the man she had
loved; he was metamorphosed to a specimen of another 
species.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not loathe you,&rsquo; she said with 
trembling.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I am so horrified&mdash;so 
overcome!&nbsp; Let me recover myself.&nbsp; Will you sup 
now?&nbsp; And while you do so may I go to my room 
to&mdash;regain my old feeling for you?&nbsp; I will try, if I 
may leave you awhile?&nbsp; Yes, I will try!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for an answer from him, and keeping her gaze 
carefully averted, the frightened woman crept to the door and out
of the room.&nbsp; She heard him sit down to the table, as if to 
begin supper though, Heaven knows, his appetite was slight enough
after a reception which had confirmed his worst surmises.&nbsp; 
When Barbara had ascended the stairs and arrived in her chamber 
she sank down, and buried her face in the coverlet of the 
bed.</p>
<p>Thus she remained for some time.&nbsp; The bed-chamber was 
over the dining-room, and presently as she knelt Barbara heard 
Willowes thrust back his chair, and rise to go into the 
hall.&nbsp; In five minutes that figure would probably come up 
the stairs and confront her again; it,&mdash;this new and 
terrible form, that was not her husband&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In the 
loneliness of this night, with neither maid nor friend beside 
her, she lost all self-control, and at the first sound of his 
footstep on the stairs, without so much as flinging a cloak round
her, she flew from the room, ran along the gallery to the back 
staircase, which she descended, and, unlocking the back door, let
herself out.&nbsp; She scarcely was aware what she had done till 
she found herself in the greenhouse, crouching on a 
flower-stand.</p>
<p>Here she remained, her great timid eyes strained through the 
glass upon the garden without, and her skirts gathered up, in 
fear of the field-mice which sometimes came there.&nbsp; Every 
moment she dreaded to hear footsteps which she ought by law to 
have longed for, and a voice that should have been as music to 
her soul.&nbsp; But Edmond Willowes came not that way.&nbsp; The 
nights were getting short at this season, and soon the dawn 
appeared, and the first rays of the sun.&nbsp; By daylight she 
had less fear than in the dark.&nbsp; She thought she could meet 
him, and accustom herself to the spectacle.</p>
<p>So the much-tried young woman unfastened the door of the 
hot-house, and went back by the way she had emerged a few hours 
ago.&nbsp; Her poor husband was probably in bed and asleep, his 
journey having been long; and she made as little noise as 
possible in her entry.&nbsp; The house was just as she had left 
it, and she looked about in the hall for his cloak and hat, but 
she could not see them; nor did she perceive the small trunk 
which had been all that he brought with him, his heavier baggage 
having been left at Southampton for the road-waggon.&nbsp; She 
summoned courage to mount the stairs; the bedroom-door was open 
as she had left it.&nbsp; She fearfully peeped round; the bed had
not been pressed.&nbsp; Perhaps he had lain down on the 
dining-room sofa.&nbsp; She descended and entered; he was not 
there.&nbsp; On the table beside his unsoiled plate lay a note, 
hastily written on the leaf of a pocket-book.&nbsp; It was 
something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My ever-beloved 
Wife</span>&mdash;The effect that my forbidding appearance has 
produced upon you was one which I foresaw as quite 
possible.&nbsp; I hoped against it, but foolishly so.&nbsp; I was
aware that no <i>human</i> love could survive such a 
catastrophe.&nbsp; I confess I thought yours <i>divine</i>; but, 
after so long an absence, there could not be left sufficient 
warmth to overcome the too natural first aversion.&nbsp; It was 
an experiment, and it has failed.&nbsp; I do not blame you; 
perhaps, even, it is better so.&nbsp; Good-bye.&nbsp; I leave 
England for one year.&nbsp; You will see me again at the 
expiration of that time, if I live.&nbsp; Then I will ascertain 
your true feeling; and, if it be against me, go away for 
ever.&nbsp; E. W.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On recovering from her surprise, Barbara&rsquo;s remorse was 
such that she felt herself absolutely unforgiveable.&nbsp; She 
should have regarded him as an afflicted being, and not have been
this slave to mere eyesight, like a child.&nbsp; To follow him 
and entreat him to return was her first thought.&nbsp; But on 
making inquiries she found that nobody had seen him: he had 
silently disappeared.</p>
<p>More than this, to undo the scene of last night was 
impossible.&nbsp; Her terror had been too plain, and he was a man
unlikely to be coaxed back by her efforts to do her duty.&nbsp; 
She went and confessed to her parents all that had occurred; 
which, indeed, soon became known to more persons than those of 
her own family.</p>
<p>The year passed, and he did not return; and it was doubted if 
he were alive.&nbsp; Barbara&rsquo;s contrition for her 
unconquerable repugnance was now such that she longed to build a 
church-aisle, or erect a monument, and devote herself to deeds of
charity for the remainder of her days.&nbsp; To that end she made
inquiry of the excellent parson under whom she sat on Sundays, at
a vertical distance of twenty feet.&nbsp; But he could only 
adjust his wig and tap his snuff-box; for such was the lukewarm 
state of religion in those days, that not an aisle, steeple, 
porch, east window, Ten-Commandment board, lion-and-unicorn, or 
brass candlestick, was required anywhere at all in the 
neighbourhood as a votive offering from a distracted 
soul&mdash;the last century contrasting greatly in this respect 
with the happy times in which we live, when urgent appeals for 
contributions to such objects pour in by every morning&rsquo;s 
post, and nearly all churches have been made to look like new 
pennies.&nbsp; As the poor lady could not ease her conscience 
this way, she determined at least to be charitable, and soon had 
the satisfaction of finding her porch thronged every morning by 
the raggedest, idlest, most drunken, hypocritical, and worthless 
tramps in Christendom.</p>
<p>But human hearts are as prone to change as the leaves of the 
creeper on the wall, and in the course of time, hearing nothing 
of her husband, Barbara could sit unmoved whilst her mother and 
friends said in her hearing, &lsquo;Well, what has happened is 
for the best.&rsquo;&nbsp; She began to think so herself; for 
even now she could not summon up that lopped and mutilated form 
without a shiver, though whenever her mind flew back to her early
wedded days, and the man who had stood beside her then, a thrill 
of tenderness moved her, which if quickened by his living 
presence might have become strong.&nbsp; She was young and 
inexperienced, and had hardly on his late return grown out of the
capricious fancies of girlhood.</p>
<p>But he did not come again, and when she thought of his word 
that he would return once more, if living, and how unlikely he 
was to break his word, she gave him up for dead.&nbsp; So did her
parents; so also did another person&mdash;that man of silence, of
irresistible incisiveness, of still countenance, who was as awake
as seven sentinels when he seemed to be as sound asleep as the 
figures on his family monument.&nbsp; Lord Uplandtowers, though 
not yet thirty, had chuckled like a caustic fogey of threescore 
when he heard of Barbara&rsquo;s terror and flight at her 
husband&rsquo;s return, and of the latter&rsquo;s prompt 
departure.&nbsp; He felt pretty sure, however, that Willowes, 
despite his hurt feelings, would have reappeared to claim his 
bright-eyed property if he had been alive at the end of the 
twelve months.</p>
<p>As there was no husband to live with her, Barbara had 
relinquished the house prepared for them by her father, and taken
up her abode anew at Chene Manor, as in the days of her 
girlhood.&nbsp; By degrees the episode with Edmond Willowes 
seemed but a fevered dream, and as the months grew to years Lord 
Uplandtowers&rsquo; friendship with the people at 
Chene&mdash;which had somewhat cooled after Barbara&rsquo;s 
elopement&mdash;revived considerably, and he again became a 
frequent visitor there.&nbsp; He could not make the most trivial 
alteration or improvement at Knollingwood Hall, where he lived, 
without riding off to consult with his friend Sir John at Chene; 
and thus putting himself frequently under her eyes, Barbara grew 
accustomed to him, and talked to him as freely as to a 
brother.&nbsp; She even began to look up to him as a person of 
authority, judgment, and prudence; and though his severity on the
bench towards poachers, smugglers, and turnip-stealers was matter
of common notoriety, she trusted that much of what was said might
be misrepresentation.</p>
<p>Thus they lived on till her husband&rsquo;s absence had 
stretched to years, and there could be no longer any doubt of his
death.&nbsp; A passionless manner of renewing his addresses 
seemed no longer out of place in Lord Uplandtowers.&nbsp; Barbara
did not love him, but hers was essentially one of those sweet-pea
or with-wind natures which require a twig of stouter fibre than 
its own to hang upon and bloom.&nbsp; Now, too, she was older, 
and admitted to herself that a man whose ancestor had run scores 
of Saracens through and through in fighting for the site of the 
Holy Sepulchre was a more desirable husband, socially considered,
than one who could only claim with certainty to know that his 
father and grandfather were respectable burgesses.</p>
<p>Sir John took occasion to inform her that she might legally 
consider herself a widow; and, in brief; Lord Uplandtowers 
carried his point with her, and she married him, though he could 
never get her to own that she loved him as she had loved 
Willowes.&nbsp; In my childhood I knew an old lady whose mother 
saw the wedding, and she said that when Lord and Lady 
Uplandtowers drove away from her father&rsquo;s house in the 
evening it was in a coach-and-four, and that my lady was dressed 
in green and silver, and wore the gayest hat and feather that 
ever were seen; though whether it was that the green did not suit
her complexion, or otherwise, the Countess looked pale, and the 
reverse of blooming.&nbsp; After their marriage her husband took 
her to London, and she saw the gaieties of a season there; then 
they returned to Knollingwood Hall, and thus a year passed 
away.</p>
<p>Before their marriage her husband had seemed to care but 
little about her inability to love him passionately.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Only let me win you,&rsquo; he had said, &lsquo;and I will
submit to all that.&rsquo;&nbsp; But now her lack of warmth 
seemed to irritate him, and he conducted himself towards her with
a resentfulness which led to her passing many hours with him in 
painful silence.&nbsp; The heir-presumptive to the title was a 
remote relative, whom Lord Uplandtowers did not exclude from the 
dislike he entertained towards many persons and things besides, 
and he had set his mind upon a lineal successor.&nbsp; He blamed 
her much that there was no promise of this, and asked her what 
she was good for.</p>
<p>On a particular day in her gloomy life a letter, addressed to 
her as Mrs. Willowes, reached Lady Uplandtowers from an 
unexpected quarter.&nbsp; A sculptor in Pisa, knowing nothing of 
her second marriage, informed her that the long-delayed life-size
statue of Mr. Willowes, which, when her husband left that city, 
he had been directed to retain till it was sent for, was still in
his studio.&nbsp; As his commission had not wholly been paid, and
the statue was taking up room he could ill spare, he should be 
glad to have the debt cleared off, and directions where to 
forward the figure.&nbsp; Arriving at a time when the Countess 
was beginning to have little secrets (of a harmless kind, it is 
true) from her husband, by reason of their growing estrangement, 
she replied to this letter without saying a word to Lord 
Uplandtowers, sending off the balance that was owing to the 
sculptor, and telling him to despatch the statue to her without 
delay.</p>
<p>It was some weeks before it arrived at Knollingwood Hall, and,
by a singular coincidence, during the interval she received the 
first absolutely conclusive tidings of her Edmond&rsquo;s 
death.&nbsp; It had taken place years before, in a foreign land, 
about six months after their parting, and had been induced by the
sufferings he had already undergone, coupled with much depression
of spirit, which had caused him to succumb to a slight 
ailment.&nbsp; The news was sent her in a brief and formal letter
from some relative of Willowes&rsquo;s in another part of 
England.</p>
<p>Her grief took the form of passionate pity for his 
misfortunes, and of reproach to herself for never having been 
able to conquer her aversion to his latter image by recollection 
of what Nature had originally made him.&nbsp; The sad spectacle 
that had gone from earth had never been her Edmond at all to 
her.&nbsp; O that she could have met him as he was at 
first!&nbsp; Thus Barbara thought.&nbsp; It was only a few days 
later that a waggon with two horses, containing an immense 
packing-case, was seen at breakfast-time both by Barbara and her 
husband to drive round to the back of the house, and by-and-by 
they were informed that a case labelled &lsquo;Sculpture&rsquo; 
had arrived for her ladyship.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What can that be?&rsquo; said Lord Uplandtowers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the statue of poor Edmond, which belongs to me, 
but has never been sent till now,&rsquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are you going to put it?&rsquo; asked he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not decided,&rsquo; said the Countess.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Anywhere, so that it will not annoy you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it won&rsquo;t annoy me,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>When it had been unpacked in a back room of the house, they 
went to examine it.&nbsp; The statue was a full-length figure, in
the purest Carrara marble, representing Edmond Willowes in all 
his original beauty, as he had stood at parting from her when 
about to set out on his travels; a specimen of manhood almost 
perfect in every line and contour.&nbsp; The work had been 
carried out with absolute fidelity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Phoebus-Apollo, sure,&rsquo; said the Earl of 
Uplandtowers, who had never seen Willowes, real or represented, 
till now.</p>
<p>Barbara did not hear him.&nbsp; She was standing in a sort of 
trance before the first husband, as if she had no consciousness 
of the other husband at her side.&nbsp; The mutilated features of
Willowes had disappeared from her mind&rsquo;s eye; this perfect 
being was really the man she had loved, and not that later 
pitiable figure; in whom love and truth should have seen this 
image always, but had not done so.</p>
<p>It was not till Lord Uplandtowers said roughly, &lsquo;Are you
going to stay here all the morning worshipping him?&rsquo; that 
she roused herself.</p>
<p>Her husband had not till now the least suspicion that Edmond 
Willowes originally looked thus, and he thought how deep would 
have been his jealousy years ago if Willowes had been known to 
him.&nbsp; Returning to the Hall in the afternoon he found his 
wife in the gallery, whither the statue had been brought.</p>
<p>She was lost in reverie before it, just as in the morning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She started and turned.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am looking at my 
husb--- my statue, to see if it is well done,&rsquo; she 
stammered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why should I not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;What are you going to do with the monstrous thing?&nbsp; 
It can&rsquo;t stand here for ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wish it,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll find a place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In her boudoir there was a deep recess, and while the Earl was
absent from home for a few days in the following week, she hired 
joiners from the village, who under her directions enclosed the 
recess with a panelled door.&nbsp; Into the tabernacle thus 
formed she had the statue placed, fastening the door with a lock,
the key of which she kept in her pocket.</p>
<p>When her husband returned he missed the statue from the 
gallery, and, concluding that it had been put away out of 
deference to his feelings, made no remark.&nbsp; Yet at moments 
he noticed something on his lady&rsquo;s face which he had never 
noticed there before.&nbsp; He could not construe it; it was a 
sort of silent ecstasy, a reserved beatification.&nbsp; What had 
become of the statue he could not divine, and growing more and 
more curious, looked about here and there for it till, thinking 
of her private room, he went towards that spot.&nbsp; After 
knocking he heard the shutting of a door, and the click of a key;
but when he entered his wife was sitting at work, on what was in 
those days called knotting.&nbsp; Lord Uplandtowers&rsquo; eye 
fell upon the newly-painted door where the recess had formerly 
been.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have been carpentering in my absence then, 
Barbara,&rsquo; he said carelessly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Uplandtowers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you go putting up such a tasteless enclosure as
that&mdash;spoiling the handsome arch of the alcove?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wanted more closet-room; and I thought that as this 
was my own apartment&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; he returned.&nbsp; Lord Uplandtowers 
knew now where the statue of young Willowes was.</p>
<p>One night, or rather in the smallest hours of the morning, he 
missed the Countess from his side.&nbsp; Not being a man of 
nervous imaginings he fell asleep again before he had much 
considered the matter, and the next morning had forgotten the 
incident.&nbsp; But a few nights later the same circumstances 
occurred.&nbsp; This time he fully roused himself; but before he 
had moved to search for her, she entered the chamber in her 
dressing-gown, carrying a candle, which she extinguished as she 
approached, deeming him asleep.&nbsp; He could discover from her 
breathing that she was strangely moved; but not on this occasion 
either did he reveal that he had seen her.&nbsp; Presently, when 
she had lain down, affecting to wake, he asked her some trivial 
questions.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, <i>Edmond</i>,&rsquo; she replied 
absently.</p>
<p>Lord Uplandtowers became convinced that she was in the habit 
of leaving the chamber in this queer way more frequently than he 
had observed, and he determined to watch.&nbsp; The next midnight
he feigned deep sleep, and shortly after perceived her stealthily
rise and let herself out of the room in the dark.&nbsp; He 
slipped on some clothing and followed.&nbsp; At the farther end 
of the corridor, where the clash of flint and steel would be out 
of the hearing of one in the bed-chamber, she struck a 
light.&nbsp; He stepped aside into an empty room till she had lit
a taper and had passed on to her boudoir.&nbsp; In a minute or 
two he followed.&nbsp; Arrived at the door of the boudoir, he 
beheld the door of the private recess open, and Barbara within 
it, standing with her arms clasped tightly round the neck of her 
Edmond, and her mouth on his.&nbsp; The shawl which she had 
thrown round her nightclothes had slipped from her shoulders, and
her long white robe and pale face lent her the blanched 
appearance of a second statue embracing the first.&nbsp; Between 
her kisses, she apostrophized it in a low murmur of infantine 
tenderness:</p>
<p>&lsquo;My only love&mdash;how could I be so cruel to you, my 
perfect one&mdash;so good and true&mdash;I am ever faithful to 
you, despite my seeming infidelity!&nbsp; I always think of 
you&mdash;dream of you&mdash;during the long hours of the day, 
and in the night-watches!&nbsp; O Edmond, I am always 
yours!&rsquo;&nbsp; Such words as these, intermingled with sobs, 
and streaming tears, and dishevelled hair, testified to an 
intensity of feeling in his wife which Lord Uplandtowers had not 
dreamed of her possessing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha, ha!&rsquo; says he to himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is
where we evaporate&mdash;this is where my hopes of a successor in
the title dissolve&mdash;ha, ha!&nbsp; This must be seen to, 
verily!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Uplandtowers was a subtle man when once he set himself to
strategy; though in the present instance he never thought of the 
simple stratagem of constant tenderness.&nbsp; Nor did he enter 
the room and surprise his wife as a blunderer would have done, 
but went back to his chamber as silently as he had left it.&nbsp;
When the Countess returned thither, shaken by spent sobs and 
sighs, he appeared to be soundly sleeping as usual.&nbsp; The 
next day he began his countermoves by making inquiries as to the 
whereabouts of the tutor who had travelled with his wife&rsquo;s 
first husband; this gentleman, he found, was now master of a 
grammar-school at no great distance from Knollingwood.&nbsp; At 
the first convenient moment Lord Uplandtowers went thither and 
obtained an interview with the said gentleman.&nbsp; The 
schoolmaster was much gratified by a visit from such an 
influential neighbour, and was ready to communicate anything that
his lordship desired to know.</p>
<p>After some general conversation on the school and its 
progress, the visitor observed that he believed the schoolmaster 
had once travelled a good deal with the unfortunate Mr. Willowes,
and had been with him on the occasion of his accident.&nbsp; He, 
Lord Uplandtowers, was interested in knowing what had really 
happened at that time, and had often thought of inquiring.&nbsp; 
And then the Earl not only heard by word of mouth as much as he 
wished to know, but, their chat becoming more intimate, the 
schoolmaster drew upon paper a sketch of the disfigured head, 
explaining with bated breath various details in the 
representation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was very strange and terrible!&rsquo; said Lord 
Uplandtowers, taking the sketch in his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Neither
nose nor ears!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A poor man in the town nearest to Knollingwood Hall, who 
combined the art of sign-painting with ingenious mechanical 
occupations, was sent for by Lord Uplandtowers to come to the 
Hall on a day in that week when the Countess had gone on a short 
visit to her parents.&nbsp; His employer made the man understand 
that the business in which his assistance was demanded was to be 
considered private, and money insured the observance of this 
request.&nbsp; The lock of the cupboard was picked, and the 
ingenious mechanic and painter, assisted by the 
schoolmaster&rsquo;s sketch, which Lord Uplandtowers had put in 
his pocket, set to work upon the god-like countenance of the 
statue under my lord&rsquo;s direction.&nbsp; What the fire had 
maimed in the original the chisel maimed in the copy.&nbsp; It 
was a fiendish disfigurement, ruthlessly carried out, and was 
rendered still more shocking by being tinted to the hues of life,
as life had been after the wreck.</p>
<p>Six hours after, when the workman was gone, Lord Uplandtowers 
looked upon the result, and smiled grimly, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;A statue should represent a man as he appeared in life,
and that&rsquo;s as he appeared.&nbsp; Ha! ha!&nbsp; But 
&rsquo;tis done to good purpose, and not idly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He locked the door of the closet with a skeleton key, and went
his way to fetch the Countess home.</p>
<p>That night she slept, but he kept awake.&nbsp; According to 
the tale, she murmured soft words in her dream; and he knew that 
the tender converse of her imaginings was held with one whom he 
had supplanted but in name.&nbsp; At the end of her dream the 
Countess of Uplandtowers awoke and arose, and then the enactment 
of former nights was repeated.&nbsp; Her husband remained still 
and listened.&nbsp; Two strokes sounded from the clock in the 
pediment without, when, leaving the chamber-door ajar, she passed
along the corridor to the other end, where, as usual, she 
obtained a light.&nbsp; So deep was the silence that he could 
even from his bed hear her softly blowing the tinder to a glow 
after striking the steel.&nbsp; She moved on into the boudoir, 
and he heard, or fancied he heard, the turning of the key in the 
closet-door.&nbsp; The next moment there came from that direction
a loud and prolonged shriek, which resounded to the farthest 
corners of the house.&nbsp; It was repeated, and there was the 
noise of a heavy fall.</p>
<p>Lord Uplandtowers sprang out of bed.&nbsp; He hastened along 
the dark corridor to the door of the boudoir, which stood ajar, 
and, by the light of the candle within, saw his poor young 
Countess lying in a heap in her nightdress on the floor of the 
closet.&nbsp; When he reached her side he found that she had 
fainted, much to the relief of his fears that matters were 
worse.&nbsp; He quickly shut up and locked in the hated image 
which had done the mischief; and lifted his wife in his arms, 
where in a few instants she opened her eyes.&nbsp; Pressing her 
face to his without saying a word, he carried her back to her 
room, endeavouring as he went to disperse her terrors by a laugh 
in her ear, oddly compounded of causticity, predilection, and 
brutality.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ho&mdash;ho&mdash;ho!&rsquo; says he.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Frightened, dear one, hey?&nbsp; What a baby 
&rsquo;tis!&nbsp; Only a joke, sure, Barbara&mdash;a splendid 
joke!&nbsp; But a baby should not go to closets at midnight to 
look for the ghost of the dear departed!&nbsp; If it do it must 
expect to be terrified at his 
aspect&mdash;ho&mdash;ho&mdash;ho!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When she was in her bed-chamber, and had quite come to 
herself; though her nerves were still much shaken, he spoke to 
her more sternly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, my lady, answer me: do you 
love him&mdash;eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;no!&rsquo; she faltered, shuddering, with her 
expanded eyes fixed on her husband.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is too 
terrible&mdash;no, no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are sure?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite sure!&rsquo; replied the poor broken-spirited 
Countess.&nbsp; But her natural elasticity asserted itself.&nbsp;
Next morning he again inquired of her: &lsquo;Do you love him 
now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She quailed under his gaze, but did not reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That means that you do still, by G---!&rsquo; he 
continued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It means that I will not tell an untruth, and do not 
wish to incense my lord,&rsquo; she answered, with dignity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then suppose we go and have another look at 
him?&rsquo;&nbsp; As he spoke, he suddenly took her by the wrist,
and turned as if to lead her towards the ghastly closet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;no!&nbsp; Oh&mdash;no!&rsquo; she cried, and 
her desperate wriggle out of his hand revealed that the fright of
the night had left more impression upon her delicate soul than 
superficially appeared.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Another dose or two, and she will be cured,&rsquo; he 
said to himself.</p>
<p>It was now so generally known that the Earl and Countess were 
not in accord, that he took no great trouble to disguise his 
deeds in relation to this matter.&nbsp; During the day he ordered
four men with ropes and rollers to attend him in the 
boudoir.&nbsp; When they arrived, the closet was open, and the 
upper part of the statue tied up in canvas.&nbsp; He had it taken
to the sleeping-chamber.&nbsp; What followed is more or less 
matter of conjecture.&nbsp; The story, as told to me, goes on to 
say that, when Lady Uplandtowers retired with him that night, she
saw near the foot of the heavy oak four-poster, a tall dark 
wardrobe, which had not stood there before; but she did not ask 
what its presence meant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have had a little whim,&rsquo; he explained when they
were in the dark.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you?&rsquo; says she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To erect a little shrine, as it may be 
called.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A little shrine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; to one whom we both equally adore&mdash;eh?&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ll show you what it contains.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pulled a cord which hung covered by the bed-curtains, and 
the doors of the wardrobe slowly opened, disclosing that the 
shelves within had been removed throughout, and the interior 
adapted to receive the ghastly figure, which stood there as it 
had stood in the boudoir, but with a wax-candle burning on each 
side of it to throw the cropped and distorted features into 
relief.&nbsp; She clutched him, uttered a low scream, and buried 
her head in the bedclothes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, take it 
away&mdash;please take it away!&rsquo; she implored.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All in good time namely, when you love me best,&rsquo; 
he returned calmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t quite 
yet&mdash;eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I think&mdash;O Uplandtowers, 
have mercy&mdash;I cannot bear it&mdash;O, in pity, take it 
away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense; one gets accustomed to anything.&nbsp; Take 
another gaze.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In short, he allowed the doors to remain unclosed at the foot 
of the bed, and the wax-tapers burning; and such was the strange 
fascination of the grisly exhibition that a morbid curiosity took
possession of the Countess as she lay, and, at his repeated 
request, she did again look out from the coverlet, shuddered, hid
her eyes, and looked again, all the while begging him to take it 
away, or it would drive her out of her senses.&nbsp; But he would
not do so as yet, and the wardrobe was not locked till dawn.</p>
<p>The scene was repeated the next night.&nbsp; Firm in enforcing
his ferocious correctives, he continued the treatment till the 
nerves of the poor lady were quivering in agony under the 
virtuous tortures inflicted by her lord, to bring her truant 
heart back to faithfulness.</p>
<p>The third night, when the scene had opened as usual, and she 
lay staring with immense wild eyes at the horrid fascination, on 
a sudden she gave an unnatural laugh; she laughed more and more, 
staring at the image, till she literally shrieked with laughter: 
then there was silence, and he found her to have become 
insensible.&nbsp; He thought she had fainted, but soon saw that 
the event was worse: she was in an epileptic fit.&nbsp; He 
started up, dismayed by the sense that, like many other subtle 
personages, he had been too exacting for his own interests.&nbsp;
Such love as he was capable of, though rather a selfish gloating 
than a cherishing solicitude, was fanned into life on the 
instant.&nbsp; He closed the wardrobe with the pulley, clasped 
her in his arms, took her gently to the window, and did all he 
could to restore her.</p>
<p>It was a long time before the Countess came to herself, and 
when she did so, a considerable change seemed to have taken place
in her emotions.&nbsp; She flung her arms around him, and with 
gasps of fear abjectly kissed him many times, at last bursting 
into tears.&nbsp; She had never wept in this scene before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll take it away, dearest&mdash;you 
will!&rsquo; she begged plaintively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you love me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do&mdash;oh, I do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And hate him, and his memory?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;yes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thoroughly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot endure recollection of him!&rsquo; cried the 
poor Countess slavishly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It fills me with 
shame&mdash;how could I ever be so depraved!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll 
never behave badly again, Uplandtowers; and you will never put 
the hated statue again before my eyes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He felt that he could promise with perfect safety.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Never,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then I&rsquo;ll love you,&rsquo; she returned 
eagerly, as if dreading lest the scourge should be applied 
anew.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll never, never dream of thinking 
a single thought that seems like faithlessness to my marriage 
vow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The strange thing now was that this fictitious love wrung from
her by terror took on, through mere habit of enactment, a certain
quality of reality.&nbsp; A servile mood of attachment to the 
Earl became distinctly visible in her contemporaneously with an 
actual dislike for her late husband&rsquo;s memory.&nbsp; The 
mood of attachment grew and continued when the statue was 
removed.&nbsp; A permanent revulsion was operant in her, which 
intensified as time wore on.&nbsp; How fright could have effected
such a change of idiosyncrasy learned physicians alone can say; 
but I believe such cases of reactionary instinct are not 
unknown.</p>
<p>The upshot was that the cure became so permanent as to be 
itself a new disease.&nbsp; She clung to him so tightly, that she
would not willingly be out of his sight for a moment.&nbsp; She 
would have no sitting-room apart from his, though she could not 
help starting when he entered suddenly to her.&nbsp; Her eyes 
were well-nigh always fixed upon him.&nbsp; If he drove out, she 
wished to go with him; his slightest civilities to other women 
made her frantically jealous; till at length her very fidelity 
became a burden to him, absorbing his time, and curtailing his 
liberty, and causing him to curse and swear.&nbsp; If he ever 
spoke sharply to her now, she did not revenge herself by flying 
off to a mental world of her own; all that affection for another,
which had provided her with a resource, was now a cold black 
cinder.</p>
<p>From that time the life of this scared and enervated 
lady&mdash;whose existence might have been developed to so much 
higher purpose but for the ignoble ambition of her parents and 
the conventions of the time&mdash;was one of obsequious 
amativeness towards a perverse and cruel man.&nbsp; Little 
personal events came to her in quick succession&mdash;half a 
dozen, eight, nine, ten such events,&mdash;in brief; she bore him
no less than eleven children in the eight following years, but 
half of them came prematurely into the world, or died a few days 
old; only one, a girl, attained to maturity; she in after years 
became the wife of the Honourable Mr. Beltonleigh, who was 
created Lord D&rsquo;Almaine, as may be remembered.</p>
<p>There was no living son and heir.&nbsp; At length, completely 
worn out in mind and body, Lady Uplandtowers was taken abroad by 
her husband, to try the effect of a more genial climate upon her 
wasted frame.&nbsp; But nothing availed to strengthen her, and 
she died at Florence, a few months after her arrival in 
Italy.</p>
<p>Contrary to expectation, the Earl of Uplandtowers did not 
marry again.&nbsp; Such affection as existed in 
him&mdash;strange, hard, brutal as it was&mdash;seemed 
untransferable, and the title, as is known, passed at his death 
to his nephew.&nbsp; Perhaps it may not be so generally known 
that, during the enlargement of the Hall for the sixth Earl, 
while digging in the grounds for the new foundations, the broken 
fragments of a marble statue were unearthed.&nbsp; They were 
submitted to various antiquaries, who said that, so far as the 
damaged pieces would allow them to form an opinion, the statue 
seemed to be that of a mutilated Roman satyr; or if not, an 
allegorical figure of Death.&nbsp; Only one or two old 
inhabitants guessed whose statue those fragments had 
composed.</p>
<p>I should have added that, shortly after the death of the 
Countess, an excellent sermon was preached by the Dean of 
Melchester, the subject of which, though names were not 
mentioned, was unquestionably suggested by the aforesaid 
events.&nbsp; He dwelt upon the folly of indulgence in sensuous 
love for a handsome form merely; and showed that the only 
rational and virtuous growths of that affection were those based 
upon intrinsic worth.&nbsp; In the case of the tender but 
somewhat shallow lady whose life I have related, there is no 
doubt that an infatuation for the person of young Willowes was 
the chief feeling that induced her to marry him; which was the 
more deplorable in that his beauty, by all tradition, was the 
least of his recommendations, every report bearing out the 
inference that he must have been a man of steadfast nature, 
bright intelligence, and promising life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The company thanked the old surgeon for his story, which the 
rural dean declared to be a far more striking one than anything 
he could hope to tell.&nbsp; An elderly member of the Club, who 
was mostly called the Bookworm, said that a woman&rsquo;s natural
instinct of fidelity would, indeed, send back her heart to a man 
after his death in a truly wonderful manner sometimes&mdash;if 
anything occurred to put before her forcibly the original 
affection between them, and his original aspect in her 
eyes,&mdash;whatever his inferiority may have been, social or 
otherwise; and then a general conversation ensued upon the power 
that a woman has of seeing the actual in the representation, the 
reality in the dream&mdash;a power which (according to the 
sentimental member) men have no faculty of equalling.</p>
<p>The rural dean thought that such cases as that related by the 
surgeon were rather an illustration of passion electrified back 
to life than of a latent, true affection.&nbsp; The story had 
suggested that he should try to recount to them one which he had 
used to hear in his youth, and which afforded an instance of the 
latter and better kind of feeling, his heroine being also a lady 
who had married beneath her, though he feared his narrative would
be of a much slighter kind than the surgeon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The 
Club begged him to proceed, and the parson began.</p>
<h2>DAME THE THIRD&mdash;THE MARCHIONESS OF STONEHENGE<br />
By the Rural Dean</h2>
<p>I would have you know, then, that a great many years ago there
lived in a classical mansion with which I used to be familiar, 
standing not a hundred miles from the city of Melchester, a lady 
whose personal charms were so rare and unparalleled that she was 
courted, flattered, and spoilt by almost all the young noblemen 
and gentlemen in that part of Wessex.&nbsp; For a time these 
attentions pleased her well.&nbsp; But as, in the words of good 
Robert South (whose sermons might be read much more than they 
are), the most passionate lover of sport, if tied to follow his 
hawks and hounds every day of his life, would find the pursuit 
the greatest torment and calamity, and would fly to the mines and
galleys for his recreation, so did this lofty and beautiful lady 
after a while become satiated with the constant iteration of what
she had in its novelty enjoyed; and by an almost natural 
revulsion turned her regards absolutely netherward, socially 
speaking.&nbsp; She perversely and passionately centred her 
affection on quite a plain-looking young man of humble birth and 
no position at all; though it is true that he was gentle and 
delicate in nature, of good address, and guileless heart.&nbsp; 
In short, he was the parish-clerk&rsquo;s son, acting as 
assistant to the land-steward of her father, the Earl of Avon, 
with the hope of becoming some day a land-steward himself.&nbsp; 
It should be said that perhaps the Lady Caroline (as she was 
called) was a little stimulated in this passion by the discovery 
that a young girl of the village already loved the young man 
fondly, and that he had paid some attentions to her, though 
merely of a casual and good-natured kind.</p>
<p>Since his occupation brought him frequently to the manor-house
and its environs, Lady Caroline could make ample opportunities of
seeing and speaking to him.&nbsp; She had, in Chaucer&rsquo;s 
phrase, &lsquo;all the craft of fine loving&rsquo; at her 
fingers&rsquo; ends, and the young man, being of a 
readily-kindling heart, was quick to notice the tenderness in her
eyes and voice.&nbsp; He could not at first believe in his good 
fortune, having no understanding of her weariness of more 
artificial men; but a time comes when the stupidest sees in an 
eye the glance of his other half; and it came to him, who was 
quite the reverse of dull.&nbsp; As he gained confidence 
accidental encounters led to encounters by design; till at length
when they were alone together there was no reserve on the 
matter.&nbsp; They whispered tender words as other lovers do, and
were as devoted a pair as ever was seen.&nbsp; But not a ray or 
symptom of this attachment was allowed to show itself to the 
outer world.</p>
<p>Now, as she became less and less scrupulous towards him under 
the influence of her affection, and he became more and more 
reverential under the influence of his, and they looked the 
situation in the face together, their condition seemed 
intolerable in its hopelessness.&nbsp; That she could ever ask to
be allowed to marry him, or could hold her tongue and quietly 
renounce him, was equally beyond conception.&nbsp; They resolved 
upon a third course, possessing neither of the disadvantages of 
these two: to wed secretly, and live on in outward appearance the
same as before.&nbsp; In this they differed from the lovers of my
friend&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>Not a soul in the parental mansion guessed, when Lady Caroline
came coolly into the hall one day after a visit to her aunt, 
that, during that visit, her lover and herself had found an 
opportunity of uniting themselves till death should part 
them.&nbsp; Yet such was the fact; the young woman who rode fine 
horses, and drove in pony-chaises, and was saluted deferentially 
by every one, and the young man who trudged about, and directed 
the tree-felling, and the laying out of fish-ponds in the park, 
were husband and wife.</p>
<p>As they had planned, so they acted to the letter for the space
of a month and more, clandestinely meeting when and where they 
best could do so; both being supremely happy and content.&nbsp; 
To be sure, towards the latter part of that month, when the first
wild warmth of her love had gone off, the Lady Caroline sometimes
wondered within herself how she, who might have chosen a peer of 
the realm, baronet, knight; or, if serious-minded, a bishop or 
judge of the more gallant sort who prefer young wives, could have
brought herself to do a thing so rash as to make this marriage; 
particularly when, in their private meetings, she perceived that 
though her young husband was full of ideas, and fairly well read,
they had not a single social experience in common.&nbsp; It was 
his custom to visit her after nightfall, in her own house, when 
he could find no opportunity for an interview elsewhere; and to 
further this course she would contrive to leave unfastened a 
window on the ground-floor overlooking the lawn, by entering 
which a back stair-case was accessible; so that he could climb up
to her apartments, and gain audience of his lady when the house 
was still.</p>
<p>One dark midnight, when he had not been able to see her during
the day, he made use of this secret method, as he had done many 
times before; and when they had remained in company about an hour
he declared that it was time for him to descend.</p>
<p>He would have stayed longer, but that the interview had been a
somewhat painful one.&nbsp; What she had said to him that night 
had much excited and angered him, for it had revealed a change in
her; cold reason had come to his lofty wife; she was beginning to
have more anxiety about her own position and prospects than 
ardour for him.&nbsp; Whether from the agitation of this 
perception or not, he was seized with a spasm; he gasped, rose, 
and in moving towards the window for air he uttered in a short 
thick whisper, &lsquo;Oh, my heart!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With his hand upon his chest he sank down to the floor before 
he had gone another step.&nbsp; By the time that she had 
relighted the candle, which had been extinguished in case any eye
in the opposite grounds should witness his egress, she found that
his poor heart had ceased to beat; and there rushed upon her mind
what his cottage-friends had once told her, that he was liable to
attacks of heart-disease, one of which, the doctor had informed 
them, might some day carry him off.</p>
<p>Accustomed as she was to doctoring the other parishioners, 
nothing that she could effect upon him in that kind made any 
difference whatever; and his stillness, and the increasing 
coldness of his feet and hands, disclosed too surely to the 
affrighted young woman that her husband was dead indeed.&nbsp; 
For more than an hour, however, she did not abandon her efforts 
to restore him; when she fully realized the fact that he was a 
corpse she bent over his body, distracted and bewildered as to 
what step she next should take.</p>
<p>Her first feelings had undoubtedly been those of passionate 
grief at the loss of him; her second thoughts were concern at her
own position as the daughter of an earl.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, why, 
why, my unfortunate husband, did you die in my chamber at this 
hour!&rsquo; she said piteously to the corpse.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why 
not have died in your own cottage if you would die!&nbsp; Then 
nobody would ever have known of our imprudent union, and no 
syllable would have been breathed of how I mismated myself for 
love of you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The clock in the courtyard striking the hour of one aroused 
Lady Caroline from the stupor into which she had fallen, and she 
stood up, and went towards the door.&nbsp; To awaken and tell her
mother seemed her only way out of this terrible situation; yet 
when she put her hand on the key to unlock it she withdrew 
herself again.&nbsp; It would be impossible to call even her 
mother&rsquo;s assistance without risking a revelation to all the
world through the servants; while if she could remove the body 
unassisted to a distance she might avert suspicion of their union
even now.&nbsp; This thought of immunity from the social 
consequences of her rash act, of renewed freedom, was indubitably
a relief to her, for, as has been said, the constraint and 
riskiness of her position had begun to tell upon the Lady 
Caroline&rsquo;s nerves.</p>
<p>She braced herself for the effort, and hastily dressed 
herself; and then dressed him.&nbsp; Tying his dead hands 
together with a handkerchief; she laid his arms round her 
shoulders, and bore him to the landing and down the narrow 
stairs.&nbsp; Reaching the bottom by the window, she let his body
slide slowly over the sill till it lay on the ground 
without.&nbsp; She then climbed over the window-sill herself, 
and, leaving the sash open, dragged him on to the lawn with a 
rustle not louder than the rustle of a broom.&nbsp; There she 
took a securer hold, and plunged with him under the trees.</p>
<p>Away from the precincts of the house she could apply herself 
more vigorously to her task, which was a heavy one enough for 
her, robust as she was; and the exertion and fright she had 
already undergone began to tell upon her by the time she reached 
the corner of a beech-plantation which intervened between the 
manor-house and the village.&nbsp; Here she was so nearly 
exhausted that she feared she might have to leave him on the 
spot.&nbsp; But she plodded on after a while, and keeping upon 
the grass at every opportunity she stood at last opposite the 
poor young man&rsquo;s garden-gate, where he lived with his 
father, the parish-clerk.&nbsp; How she accomplished the end of 
her task Lady Caroline never quite knew; but, to avoid leaving 
traces in the road, she carried him bodily across the gravel, and
laid him down at the door.&nbsp; Perfectly aware of his ways of 
coming and going, she searched behind the shutter for the cottage
door-key, which she placed in his cold hand.&nbsp; Then she 
kissed his face for the last time, and with silent little sobs 
bade him farewell.</p>
<p>Lady Caroline retraced her steps, and reached the mansion 
without hindrance; and to her great relief found the window open 
just as she had left it.&nbsp; When she had climbed in she 
listened attentively, fastened the window behind her, and 
ascending the stairs noiselessly to her room, set everything in 
order, and returned to bed.</p>
<p>The next morning it was speedily echoed around that the 
amiable and gentle young villager had been found dead outside his
father&rsquo;s door, which he had apparently been in the act of 
unlocking when he fell.&nbsp; The circumstances were sufficiently
exceptional to justify an inquest, at which syncope from 
heart-disease was ascertained to be beyond doubt the explanation 
of his death, and no more was said about the matter then.&nbsp; 
But, after the funeral, it was rumoured that some man who had 
been returning late from a distant horse-fair had seen in the 
gloom of night a person, apparently a woman, dragging a heavy 
body of some sort towards the cottage-gate, which, by the light 
of after events, would seem to have been the corpse of the young 
fellow.&nbsp; His clothes were thereupon examined more 
particularly than at first, with the result that marks of 
friction were visible upon them here and there, precisely 
resembling such as would be left by dragging on the ground.</p>
<p>Our beautiful and ingenious Lady Caroline was now in great 
consternation; and began to think that, after all, it might have 
been better to honestly confess the truth.&nbsp; But having 
reached this stage without discovery or suspicion, she determined
to make another effort towards concealment; and a bright idea 
struck her as a means of securing it.&nbsp; I think I mentioned 
that, before she cast eyes on the unfortunate steward&rsquo;s 
clerk, he had been the beloved of a certain village damsel, the 
woodman&rsquo;s daughter, his neighbour, to whom he had paid some
attentions; and possibly he was beloved of her still.&nbsp; At 
any rate, the Lady Caroline&rsquo;s influence on the estates of 
her father being considerable, she resolved to seek an interview 
with the young girl in furtherance of her plan to save her 
reputation, about which she was now exceedingly anxious; for by 
this time, the fit being over, she began to be ashamed of her mad
passion for her late husband, and almost wished she had never 
seen him.</p>
<p>In the course of her parish-visiting she lighted on the young 
girl without much difficulty, and found her looking pale and sad,
and wearing a simple black gown, which she had put on out of 
respect for the young man&rsquo;s memory, whom she had tenderly 
loved, though he had not loved her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you have lost your lover, Milly,&rsquo; said Lady 
Caroline.</p>
<p>The young woman could not repress her tears.&nbsp; &lsquo;My 
lady, he was not quite my lover,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;But I was his&mdash;and now he is dead I don&rsquo;t care 
to live any more!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you keep a secret about him?&rsquo; asks the lady; 
&lsquo;one in which his honour is involved&mdash;which is known 
to me alone, but should be known to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl readily promised, and, indeed, could be safely 
trusted on such a subject, so deep was her affection for the 
youth she mourned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then meet me at his grave to-night, half-an-hour after 
sunset, and I will tell it to you,&rsquo; says the other.</p>
<p>In the dusk of that spring evening the two shadowy figures of 
the young women converged upon the assistant-steward&rsquo;s 
newly-turfed mound; and at that solemn place and hour, the one of
birth and beauty unfolded her tale: how she had loved him and 
married him secretly; how he had died in her chamber; and how, to
keep her secret, she had dragged him to his own door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Married him, my lady!&rsquo; said the rustic maiden, 
starting back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have said so,&rsquo; replied Lady Caroline.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;But it was a mad thing, and a mistaken course.&nbsp; He 
ought to have married you.&nbsp; You, Milly, were peculiarly 
his.&nbsp; But you lost him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the poor girl; &lsquo;and for that 
they laughed at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha&mdash;ha, you mid love him, 
Milly,&rdquo; they said; &ldquo;but he will not love 
you!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Victory over such unkind jeerers would be sweet,&rsquo;
said Lady Caroline.&nbsp; &lsquo;You lost him in life; but you 
may have him in death <i>as if</i> you had had him in life; and 
so turn the tables upon them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How?&rsquo; said the breathless girl.</p>
<p>The young lady then unfolded her plan, which was that Milly 
should go forward and declare that the young man had contracted a
secret marriage (as he truly had done); that it was with her, 
Milly, his sweetheart; that he had been visiting her in her 
cottage on the evening of his death; when, on finding he was a 
corpse, she had carried him to his house to prevent discovery by 
her parents, and that she had meant to keep the whole matter a 
secret till the rumours afloat had forced it from her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how shall I prove this?&rsquo; said the 
woodman&rsquo;s daughter, amazed at the boldness of the 
proposal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite sufficiently.&nbsp; You can say, if necessary, 
that you were married to him at the church of St. Michael, in 
Bath City, in my name, as the first that occurred to you, to 
escape detection.&nbsp; That was where he married me.&nbsp; I 
will support you in this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh&mdash;I don&rsquo;t quite like&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you will do so,&rsquo; said the lady peremptorily, 
&lsquo;I will always be your father&rsquo;s friend and yours; if 
not, it will be otherwise.&nbsp; And I will give you my 
wedding-ring, which you shall wear as yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you worn it, my lady?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only at night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was not much choice in the matter, and Milly 
consented.&nbsp; Then this noble lady took from her bosom the 
ring she had never been able openly to exhibit, and, grasping the
young girl&rsquo;s hand, slipped it upon her finger as she stood 
upon her lover&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p>Milly shivered, and bowed her head, saying, &lsquo;I feel as 
if I had become a corpse&rsquo;s bride!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But from that moment the maiden was heart and soul in the 
substitution.&nbsp; A blissful repose came over her spirit.&nbsp;
It seemed to her that she had secured in death him whom in life 
she had vainly idolized; and she was almost content.&nbsp; After 
that the lady handed over to the young man&rsquo;s new wife all 
the little mementoes and trinkets he had given herself; even to a
locket containing his hair.</p>
<p>The next day the girl made her so-called confession, which the
simple mourning she had already worn, without stating for whom, 
seemed to bear out; and soon the story of the little romance 
spread through the village and country-side, almost as far as 
Melchester.&nbsp; It was a curious psychological fact that, 
having once made the avowal, Milly seemed possessed with a spirit
of ecstasy at her position.&nbsp; With the liberal sum of money 
supplied to her by Lady Caroline she now purchased the garb of a 
widow, and duly appeared at church in her weeds, her simple face 
looking so sweet against its margin of crape that she was almost 
envied her state by the other village-girls of her age.&nbsp; And
when a woman&rsquo;s sorrow for her beloved can maim her young 
life so obviously as it had done Milly&rsquo;s there was, in 
truth, little subterfuge in the case.&nbsp; Her explanation 
tallied so well with the details of her lover&rsquo;s latter 
movements&mdash;those strange absences and sudden returnings, 
which had occasionally puzzled his friends&mdash;that nobody 
supposed for a moment that the second actor in these secret 
nuptials was other than she.&nbsp; The actual and whole truth 
would indeed have seemed a preposterous assertion beside this 
plausible one, by reason of the lofty demeanour of the Lady 
Caroline and the unassuming habits of the late villager.&nbsp; 
There being no inheritance in question, not a soul took the 
trouble to go to the city church, forty miles off, and search the
registers for marriage signatures bearing out so humble a 
romance.</p>
<p>In a short time Milly caused a decent tombstone to be erected 
over her nominal husband&rsquo;s grave, whereon appeared the 
statement that it was placed there by his heartbroken widow, 
which, considering that the payment for it came from Lady 
Caroline and the grief from Milly, was as truthful as such 
inscriptions usually are, and only required pluralizing to render
it yet more nearly so.</p>
<p>The impressionable and complaisant Milly, in her character of 
widow, took delight in going to his grave every day, and 
indulging in sorrow which was a positive luxury to her.&nbsp; She
placed fresh flowers on his grave, and so keen was her emotional 
imaginativeness that she almost believed herself to have been his
wife indeed as she walked to and fro in her garb of woe.&nbsp; 
One afternoon, Milly being busily engaged in this labour of love 
at the grave, Lady Caroline passed outside the churchyard wall 
with some of her visiting friends, who, seeing Milly there, 
watched her actions with interest, remarked upon the pathos of 
the scene, and upon the intense affection the young man must have
felt for such a tender creature as Milly.&nbsp; A strange light, 
as of pain, shot from the Lady Caroline&rsquo;s eye, as if for 
the first time she begrudged to the young girl the position she 
had been at such pains to transfer to her; it showed that a 
slumbering affection for her husband still had life in Lady 
Caroline, obscured and stifled as it was by social 
considerations.</p>
<p>An end was put to this smooth arrangement by the sudden 
appearance in the churchyard one day of the Lady Caroline, when 
Milly had come there on her usual errand of laying flowers.&nbsp;
Lady Caroline had been anxiously awaiting her behind the chancel,
and her countenance was pale and agitated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Milly!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;come here!&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t know how to say to you what I am going to say.&nbsp; 
I am half dead!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry for your ladyship,&rsquo; says Milly, 
wondering.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me that ring!&rsquo; says the lady, snatching at 
the girl&rsquo;s left hand.</p>
<p>Milly drew it quickly away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you give it to me!&rsquo; repeated Caroline, 
almost fiercely.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh&mdash;but you don&rsquo;t know 
why?&nbsp; I am in a grief and a trouble I did not 
expect!&rsquo;&nbsp; And Lady Caroline whispered a few words to 
the girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O my lady!&rsquo; said the thunderstruck Milly.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;What <i>will</i> you do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must say that your statement was a wicked lie, an 
invention, a scandal, a deadly sin&mdash;that I told you to make 
it to screen me!&nbsp; That it was I whom he married at 
Bath.&nbsp; In short, we must tell the truth, or I am 
ruined&mdash;body, mind, and reputation&mdash;for 
ever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But there is a limit to the flexibility of gentle-souled 
women.&nbsp; Milly by this time had so grown to the idea of being
one flesh with this young man, of having the right to bear his 
name as she bore it; had so thoroughly come to regard him as her 
husband, to dream of him as her husband, to speak of him as her 
husband, that she could not relinquish him at a moment&rsquo;s 
peremptory notice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; she said desperately, &lsquo;I cannot, I
will not give him up!&nbsp; Your ladyship took him away from me 
alive, and gave him back to me only when he was dead.&nbsp; Now I
will keep him!&nbsp; I am truly his widow.&nbsp; More truly than 
you, my lady! for I love him and mourn for him, and call myself 
by his dear name, and your ladyship does neither!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I <i>do</i> love him!&rsquo; cries Lady Caroline with 
flashing eyes, &lsquo;and I cling to him, and won&rsquo;t let him
go to such as you!&nbsp; How can I, when he is the father of this
poor babe that&rsquo;s coming to me?&nbsp; I must have him back 
again!&nbsp; Milly, Milly, can&rsquo;t you pity and understand 
me, perverse girl that you are, and the miserable plight that I 
am in?&nbsp; Oh, this precipitancy&mdash;it is the ruin of 
women!&nbsp; Why did I not consider, and wait!&nbsp; Come, give 
me back all that I have given you, and assure me you will support
me in confessing the truth!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, never!&rsquo; persisted Milly, with woe-begone 
passionateness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look at this headstone!&nbsp; Look 
at my gown and bonnet of crape&mdash;this ring: listen to the 
name they call me by!&nbsp; My character is worth as much to me 
as yours is to you!&nbsp; After declaring my Love mine, myself 
his, taking his name, making his death my own particular sorrow, 
how can I say it was not so?&nbsp; No such dishonour for 
me!&nbsp; I will outswear you, my lady; and I shall be 
believed.&nbsp; My story is so much the more likely that yours 
will be thought false.&nbsp; But, O please, my lady, do not drive
me to this!&nbsp; In pity let me keep him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The poor nominal widow exhibited such anguish at a proposal 
which would have been truly a bitter humiliation to her, that 
Lady Caroline was warmed to pity in spite of her own 
condition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I see your position,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;But think of mine!&nbsp; What can I do?&nbsp; Without your
support it would seem an invention to save me from disgrace; even
if I produced the register, the love of scandal in the world is 
such that the multitude would slur over the fact, say it was a 
fabrication, and believe your story.&nbsp; I do not know who were
the witnesses, or anything!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes these two poor young women felt, as so many 
in a strait have felt before, that union was their greatest 
strength, even now; and they consulted calmly together.&nbsp; The
result of their deliberations was that Milly went home as usual, 
and Lady Caroline also, the latter confessing that very night to 
the Countess her mother of the marriage, and to nobody else in 
the world.&nbsp; And, some time after, Lady Caroline and her 
mother went away to London, where a little while later still they
were joined by Milly, who was supposed to have left the village 
to proceed to a watering-place in the North for the benefit of 
her health, at the expense of the ladies of the Manor, who had 
been much interested in her state of lonely and defenceless 
widowhood.</p>
<p>Early the next year the widow Milly came home with an infant 
in her arms, the family at the Manor House having meanwhile gone 
abroad.&nbsp; They did not return from their tour till the autumn
ensuing, by which time Milly and the child had again departed 
from the cottage of her father the woodman, Milly having attained
to the dignity of dwelling in a cottage of her own, many miles to
the eastward of her native village; a comfortable little 
allowance had moreover been settled on her and the child for 
life, through the instrumentality of Lady Caroline and her 
mother.</p>
<p>Two or three years passed away, and the Lady Caroline married 
a nobleman&mdash;the Marquis of Stonehenge&mdash;considerably her
senior, who had wooed her long and phlegmatically.&nbsp; He was 
not rich, but she led a placid life with him for many years, 
though there was no child of the marriage.&nbsp; Meanwhile 
Milly&rsquo;s boy, as the youngster was called, and as Milly 
herself considered him, grew up, and throve wonderfully, and 
loved her as she deserved to be loved for her devotion to him, in
whom she every day traced more distinctly the lineaments of the 
man who had won her girlish heart, and kept it even in the 
tomb.</p>
<p>She educated him as well as she could with the limited means 
at her disposal, for the allowance had never been increased, Lady
Caroline, or the Marchioness of Stonehenge as she now was, 
seeming by degrees to care little what had become of them.&nbsp; 
Milly became extremely ambitious on the boy&rsquo;s account; she 
pinched herself almost of necessaries to send him to the Grammar 
School in the town to which they retired, and at twenty he 
enlisted in a cavalry regiment, joining it with a deliberate 
intent of making the Army his profession, and not in a freak of 
idleness.&nbsp; His exceptional attainments, his manly bearing, 
his steady conduct, speedily won him promotion, which was 
furthered by the serious war in which this country was at that 
time engaged.&nbsp; On his return to England after the peace he 
had risen to the rank of riding-master, and was soon after 
advanced another stage, and made quartermaster, though still a 
young man.</p>
<p>His mother&mdash;his corporeal mother, that is, the 
Marchioness of Stonehenge&mdash;heard tidings of this unaided 
progress; it reawakened her maternal instincts, and filled her 
with pride.&nbsp; She became keenly interested in her successful 
soldier-son; and as she grew older much wished to see him again, 
particularly when, the Marquis dying, she was left a solitary and
childless widow.&nbsp; Whether or not she would have gone to him 
of her own impulse I cannot say; but one day, when she was 
driving in an open carriage in the outskirts of a neighbouring 
town, the troops lying at the barracks hard by passed her in 
marching order.&nbsp; She eyed them narrowly, and in the finest 
of the horsemen recognized her son from his likeness to her first
husband.</p>
<p>This sight of him doubly intensified the motherly emotions 
which had lain dormant in her for so many years, and she wildly 
asked herself how she could so have neglected him?&nbsp; Had she 
possessed the true courage of affection she would have owned to 
her first marriage, and have reared him as her son!&nbsp; What 
would it have mattered if she had never obtained this precious 
coronet of pearls and gold leaves, by comparison with the gain of
having the love and protection of such a noble and worthy 
son?&nbsp; These and other sad reflections cut the gloomy and 
solitary lady to the heart; and she repented of her pride in 
disclaiming her first husband more bitterly than she had ever 
repented of her infatuation in marrying him.</p>
<p>Her yearning was so strong, that at length it seemed to her 
that she could not live without announcing herself to him as his 
mother.&nbsp; Come what might, she would do it: late as it was, 
she would have him away from that woman whom she began to hate 
with the fierceness of a deserted heart, for having taken her 
place as the mother of her only child.&nbsp; She felt confidently
enough that her son would only too gladly exchange a 
cottage-mother for one who was a peeress of the realm.&nbsp; 
Being now, in her widowhood, free to come and go as she chose, 
without question from anybody, Lady Stonehenge started next day 
for the little town where Milly yet lived, still in her robes of 
sable for the lost lover of her youth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is <i>my</i> son,&rsquo; said the Marchioness, as 
soon as she was alone in the cottage with Milly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
must give him back to me, now that I am in a position in which I 
can defy the world&rsquo;s opinion.&nbsp; I suppose he comes to 
see you continually?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every month since he returned from the war, my 
lady.&nbsp; And sometimes he stays two or three days, and takes 
me about seeing sights everywhere!&rsquo;&nbsp; She spoke with 
quiet triumph.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you will have to give him up,&rsquo; said the 
Marchioness calmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It shall not be the worse for 
you&mdash;you may see him when you choose.&nbsp; I am going to 
avow my first marriage, and have him with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You forget that there are two to be reckoned with, my 
lady.&nbsp; Not only me, but himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That can be arranged.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t suppose 
that he wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; But not wishing to 
insult Milly by comparing their positions, she said, &lsquo;He is
my own flesh and blood, not yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Flesh and blood&rsquo;s nothing!&rsquo; said Milly, 
flashing with as much scorn as a cottager could show to a 
peeress, which, in this case, was not so little as may be 
supposed.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I will agree to put it to him, and let
him settle it for himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all I require,&rsquo; said Lady 
Stonehenge.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must ask him to come, and I will 
meet him here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The soldier was written to, and the meeting took place.&nbsp; 
He was not so much astonished at the disclosure of his parentage 
as Lady Stonehenge had been led to expect, having known for years
that there was a little mystery about his birth.&nbsp; His manner
towards the Marchioness, though respectful, was less warm than 
she could have hoped.&nbsp; The alternatives as to his choice of 
a mother were put before him.&nbsp; His answer amazed and 
stupefied her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my lady,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thank you 
much, but I prefer to let things be as they have been.&nbsp; My 
father&rsquo;s name is mine in any case.&nbsp; You see, my lady, 
you cared little for me when I was weak and helpless; why should 
I come to you now I am strong?&nbsp; She, dear devoted soul 
[pointing to Milly], tended me from my birth, watched over me, 
nursed me when I was ill, and deprived herself of many a little 
comfort to push me on.&nbsp; I cannot love another mother as I 
love her.&nbsp; She <i>is</i> my mother, and I will always be her
son!&rsquo;&nbsp; As he spoke he put his manly arm round 
Milly&rsquo;s neck, and kissed her with the tenderest 
affection.</p>
<p>The agony of the poor Marchioness was pitiable.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You kill me!&rsquo; she said, between her shaking 
sobs.&nbsp; &lsquo;Cannot 
you&mdash;love&mdash;me&mdash;too?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my lady.&nbsp; If I must say it, you were ashamed 
of my poor father, who was a sincere and honest man; therefore, I
am ashamed of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nothing would move him; and the suffering woman at last 
gasped, &lsquo;Cannot&mdash;oh, cannot you give one kiss to 
me&mdash;as you did to her?&nbsp; It is not much&mdash;it is all 
I ask&mdash;all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>He kissed her coldly, and the painful scene came to an 
end.&nbsp; That day was the beginning of death to the unfortunate
Marchioness of Stonehenge.&nbsp; It was in the perverseness of 
her human heart that his denial of her should add fuel to the 
fire of her craving for his love.&nbsp; How long afterwards she 
lived I do not know with any exactness, but it was no great 
length of time.&nbsp; That anguish that is sharper than a 
serpent&rsquo;s tooth wore her out soon.&nbsp; Utterly reckless 
of the world, its ways, and its opinions, she allowed her story 
to become known; and when the welcome end supervened (which, I 
grieve to say, she refused to lighten by the consolations of 
religion), a broken heart was the truest phrase in which to sum 
up its cause.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The rural dean having concluded, some observations upon his 
tale were made in due course.&nbsp; The sentimental member said 
that Lady Caroline&rsquo;s history afforded a sad instance of how
an honest human affection will become shamefaced and mean under 
the frost of class-division and social prejudices.&nbsp; She 
probably deserved some pity; though her offspring, before he grew
up to man&rsquo;s estate, had deserved more.&nbsp; There was no 
pathos like the pathos of childhood, when a child found itself in
a world where it was not wanted, and could not understand the 
reason why.&nbsp; A tale by the speaker, further illustrating the
same subject, though with different results from the last, 
naturally followed.</p>
<h2>DAME THE FOURTH&mdash;LADY MOTTISFONT<br />
By the Sentimental Member</h2>
<p>Of all the romantic towns in Wessex, Wintoncester is probably 
the most convenient for meditative people to live in; since there
you have a cathedral with a nave so long that it affords space in
which to walk and summon your remoter moods without continually 
turning on your heel, or seeming to do more than take an 
afternoon stroll under cover from the rain or sun.&nbsp; In an 
uninterrupted course of nearly three hundred steps eastward, and 
again nearly three hundred steps westward amid those magnificent 
tombs, you can, for instance, compare in the most leisurely way 
the dry dustiness which ultimately pervades the persons of kings 
and bishops with the damper dustiness that is usually the final 
shape of commoners, curates, and others who take their last rest 
out of doors.&nbsp; Then, if you are in love, you can, by 
sauntering in the chapels and behind the episcopal chantries with
the bright-eyed one, so steep and mellow your ecstasy in the 
solemnities around, that it will assume a rarer and finer 
tincture, even more grateful to the understanding, if not to the 
senses, than that form of the emotion which arises from such 
companionship in spots where all is life, and growth, and 
fecundity.</p>
<p>It was in this solemn place, whither they had withdrawn from 
the sight of relatives on one cold day in March, that Sir Ashley 
Mottisfont asked in marriage, as his second wife, Philippa, the 
gentle daughter of plain Squire Okehall.&nbsp; Her life had been 
an obscure one thus far; while Sir Ashley, though not a rich man,
had a certain distinction about him; so that everybody thought 
what a convenient, elevating, and, in a word, blessed match it 
would be for such a supernumerary as she.&nbsp; Nobody thought so
more than the amiable girl herself.&nbsp; She had been smitten 
with such affection for him that, when she walked the cathedral 
aisles at his side on the before-mentioned day, she did not know 
that her feet touched hard pavement; it seemed to her rather that
she was floating in space.&nbsp; Philippa was an ecstatic, 
heart-thumping maiden, and could not understand how she had 
deserved to have sent to her such an illustrious lover, such a 
travelled personage, such a handsome man.</p>
<p>When he put the question, it was in no clumsy language, such 
as the ordinary bucolic county landlords were wont to use on like
quivering occasions, but as elegantly as if he had been taught it
in Enfield&rsquo;s <i>Speaker</i>.&nbsp; Yet he hesitated a 
little&mdash;for he had something to add.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My pretty Philippa,&rsquo; he said (she was not very 
pretty by the way), &lsquo;I have, you must know, a little girl 
dependent upon me: a little waif I found one day in a patch of 
wild oats [such was this worthy baronet&rsquo;s humour] when I 
was riding home: a little nameless creature, whom I wish to take 
care of till she is old enough to take care of herself; and to 
educate in a plain way.&nbsp; She is only fifteen months old, and
is at present in the hands of a kind villager&rsquo;s wife in my 
parish.&nbsp; Will you object to give some attention to the 
little thing in her helplessness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It need hardly be said that our innocent young lady, loving 
him so deeply and joyfully as she did, replied that she would do 
all she could for the nameless child; and, shortly afterwards, 
the pair were married in the same cathedral that had echoed the 
whispers of his declaration, the officiating minister being the 
Bishop himself; a venerable and experienced man, so well 
accomplished in uniting people who had a mind for that sort of 
experiment, that the couple, with some sense of surprise, found 
themselves one while they were still vaguely gazing at each other
as two independent beings.</p>
<p>After this operation they went home to Deansleigh Park, and 
made a beginning of living happily ever after.&nbsp; Lady 
Mottisfont, true to her promise, was always running down to the 
village during the following weeks to see the baby whom her 
husband had so mysteriously lighted on during his ride 
home&mdash;concerning which interesting discovery she had her own
opinion; but being so extremely amiable and affectionate that she
could have loved stocks and stones if there had been no living 
creatures to love, she uttered none of her thoughts.&nbsp; The 
little thing, who had been christened Dorothy, took to Lady 
Mottisfont as if the baronet&rsquo;s young wife had been her 
mother; and at length Philippa grew so fond of the child that she
ventured to ask her husband if she might have Dorothy in her own 
home, and bring her up carefully, just as if she were her 
own.&nbsp; To this he answered that, though remarks might be made
thereon, he had no objection; a fact which was obvious, Sir 
Ashley seeming rather pleased than otherwise with the 
proposal.</p>
<p>After this they lived quietly and uneventfully for two or 
three years at Sir Ashley Mottisfont&rsquo;s residence in that 
part of England, with as near an approach to bliss as the climate
of this country allows.&nbsp; The child had been a godsend to 
Philippa, for there seemed no great probability of her having one
of her own: and she wisely regarded the possession of Dorothy as 
a special kindness of Providence, and did not worry her mind at 
all as to Dorothy&rsquo;s possible origin.&nbsp; Being a tender 
and impulsive creature, she loved her husband without criticism, 
exhaustively and religiously, and the child not much 
otherwise.&nbsp; She watched the little foundling as if she had 
been her own by nature, and Dorothy became a great solace to her 
when her husband was absent on pleasure or business; and when he 
came home he looked pleased to see how the two had won each 
other&rsquo;s hearts.&nbsp; Sir Ashley would kiss his wife, and 
his wife would kiss little Dorothy, and little Dorothy would kiss
Sir Ashley, and after this triangular burst of affection Lady 
Mottisfont would say, &lsquo;Dear me&mdash;I forget she is not 
mine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does it matter?&rsquo; her husband would 
reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;Providence is fore-knowing.&nbsp; He has sent
us this one because he is not intending to send us one by any 
other channel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Their life was of the simplest.&nbsp; Since his travels the 
baronet had taken to sporting and farming; while Philippa was a 
pattern of domesticity.&nbsp; Their pleasures were all 
local.&nbsp; They retired early to rest, and rose with the 
cart-horses and whistling waggoners.&nbsp; They knew the names of
every bird and tree not exceptionally uncommon, and could 
foretell the weather almost as well as anxious farmers and old 
people with corns.</p>
<p>One day Sir Ashley Mottisfont received a letter, which he 
read, and musingly laid down on the table without remark.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it, dearest?&rsquo; asked his wife, glancing at
the sheet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it is from an old lawyer at Bath whom I used to 
know.&nbsp; He reminds me of something I said to him four or five
years ago&mdash;some little time before we were 
married&mdash;about Dorothy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What about her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a casual remark I made to him, when I thought 
you might not take kindly to her, that if he knew a lady who was 
anxious to adopt a child, and could insure a good home to 
Dorothy, he was to let me know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But that was when you had nobody to take care of 
her,&rsquo; she said quickly.&nbsp; &lsquo;How absurd of him to 
write now!&nbsp; Does he know you are married?&nbsp; He must, 
surely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He handed her the letter.&nbsp; The solicitor stated that a 
widow-lady of position, who did not at present wish her name to 
be disclosed, had lately become a client of his while taking the 
waters, and had mentioned to him that she would like a little 
girl to bring up as her own, if she could be certain of finding 
one of good and pleasing disposition; and, the better to insure 
this, she would not wish the child to be too young for judging 
her qualities.&nbsp; He had remembered Sir Ashley&rsquo;s 
observation to him a long while ago, and therefore brought the 
matter before him.&nbsp; It would be an excellent home for the 
little girl&mdash;of that he was positive&mdash;if she had not 
already found such a home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is absurd of the man to write so long 
after!&rsquo; said Lady Mottisfont, with a lumpiness about the 
back of her throat as she thought how much Dorothy had become to 
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;I suppose it was when you first&mdash;found 
her&mdash;that you told him this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly&mdash;it was then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He fell into thought, and neither Sir Ashley nor Lady 
Mottisfont took the trouble to answer the lawyer&rsquo;s letter; 
and so the matter ended for the time.</p>
<p>One day at dinner, on their return from a short absence in 
town, whither they had gone to see what the world was doing, hear
what it was saying, and to make themselves generally fashionable 
after rusticating for so long&mdash;on this occasion, I say, they
learnt from some friend who had joined them at dinner that 
Fernell Hall&mdash;the manorial house of the estate next their 
own, which had been offered on lease by reason of the 
impecuniosity of its owner&mdash;had been taken for a term by a 
widow lady, an Italian Contessa, whose name I will not mention 
for certain reasons which may by and by appear.&nbsp; Lady 
Mottisfont expressed her surprise and interest at the probability
of having such a neighbour.&nbsp; &lsquo;Though, if I had been 
born in Italy, I think I should have liked to remain 
there,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is not Italian, though her husband was,&rsquo; said
Sir Ashley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you have heard about her before now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; they were talking of her at Grey&rsquo;s the other
evening.&nbsp; She is English.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, as her 
husband said no more about the lady, the friend who was dining 
with them told Lady Mottisfont that the Countess&rsquo;s father 
had speculated largely in East-India Stock, in which immense 
fortunes were being made at that time; through this his daughter 
had found herself enormously wealthy at his death, which had 
occurred only a few weeks after the death of her husband.&nbsp; 
It was supposed that the marriage of an enterprising English 
speculator&rsquo;s daughter to a poor foreign nobleman had been 
matter of arrangement merely.&nbsp; As soon as the 
Countess&rsquo;s widowhood was a little further advanced she 
would, no doubt, be the mark of all the schemers who came near 
her, for she was still quite young.&nbsp; But at present she 
seemed to desire quiet, and avoided society and town.</p>
<p>Some weeks after this time Sir Ashley Mottisfont sat looking 
fixedly at his lady for many moments.&nbsp; He said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It might have been better for Dorothy if the Countess 
had taken her.&nbsp; She is so wealthy in comparison with 
ourselves, and could have ushered the girl into the great world 
more effectually than we ever shall be able to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Contessa take Dorothy?&rsquo; said Lady Mottisfont 
with a start.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&mdash;was she the lady who wished
to adopt her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; she was staying at Bath when Lawyer Gayton wrote 
to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how do you know all this, Ashley?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He showed a little hesitation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve 
seen her,&rsquo; he says.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know, she drives to 
the meet sometimes, though she does not ride; and she has 
informed me that she was the lady who inquired of 
Gayton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have talked to her as well as seen her, 
then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, several times; everybody has.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rsquo; says his 
lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had quite forgotten to call upon her.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ll go to-morrow, or soon . . . But I can&rsquo;t think, 
Ashley, how you can say that it might have been better for 
Dorothy to have gone to her; she is so much our own now that I 
cannot admit any such conjectures as those, even in 
jest.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her eyes reproached him so eloquently that Sir
Ashley Mottisfont did not answer.</p>
<p>Lady Mottisfont did not hunt any more than the Anglo-Italian 
Countess did; indeed, she had become so absorbed in household 
matters and in Dorothy&rsquo;s wellbeing that she had no mind to 
waste a minute on mere enjoyments.&nbsp; As she had said, to talk
coolly of what might have been the best destination in days past 
for a child to whom they had become so attached seemed quite 
barbarous, and she could not understand how her husband should 
consider the point so abstractedly; for, as will probably have 
been guessed, Lady Mottisfont long before this time, if she had 
not done so at the very beginning, divined Sir Ashley&rsquo;s 
true relation to Dorothy.&nbsp; But the baronet&rsquo;s wife was 
so discreetly meek and mild that she never told him of her 
surmise, and took what Heaven had sent her without cavil, her 
generosity in this respect having been bountifully rewarded by 
the new life she found in her love for the little girl.</p>
<p>Her husband recurred to the same uncomfortable subject when, a
few days later, they were speaking of travelling abroad.&nbsp; He
said that it was almost a pity, if they thought of going, that 
they had not fallen in with the Countess&rsquo;s wish.&nbsp; That
lady had told him that she had met Dorothy walking with her 
nurse, and that she had never seen a child she liked so well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;she covets her still?&nbsp; How impertinent 
of the woman!&rsquo; said Lady Mottisfont.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She seems to do so . . . You see, dearest Philippa, the
advantage to Dorothy would have been that the Countess would have
adopted her legally, and have made her as her own daughter; while
we have not done that&mdash;we are only bringing up and educating
a poor child in charity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll adopt her fully&mdash;make her mine 
legally!&rsquo; cried his wife in an anxious voice.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;How is it to be done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m.&rsquo;&nbsp; He did not inform her, but fell
into thought; and, for reasons of her own, his lady was restless 
and uneasy.</p>
<p>The very next day Lady Mottisfont drove to Fernell Hall to pay
the neglected call upon her neighbour.&nbsp; The Countess was at 
home, and received her graciously.&nbsp; But poor Lady 
Mottisfont&rsquo;s heart died within her as soon as she set eyes 
on her new acquaintance.&nbsp; Such wonderful beauty, of the 
fully-developed kind, had never confronted her before inside the 
lines of a human face.&nbsp; She seemed to shine with every light
and grace that woman can possess.&nbsp; Her finished Continental 
manners, her expanded mind, her ready wit, composed a study that 
made the other poor lady sick; for she, and latterly Sir Ashley 
himself, were rather rural in manners, and she felt abashed by 
new sounds and ideas from without.&nbsp; She hardly knew three 
words in any language but her own, while this divine creature, 
though truly English, had, apparently, whatever she wanted in the
Italian and French tongues to suit every impression; which was 
considered a great improvement to speech in those days, and, 
indeed, is by many considered as such in these.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How very strange it was about the little girl!&rsquo; 
the Contessa said to Lady Mottisfont, in her gay tones.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I mean, that the child the lawyer recommended should, just
before then, have been adopted by you, who are now my 
neighbour.&nbsp; How is she getting on?&nbsp; I must come and see
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you still want her?&rsquo; asks Lady Mottisfont 
suspiciously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I should like to have her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you can&rsquo;t!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s mine!&rsquo; 
said the other greedily.</p>
<p>A drooping manner appeared in the Countess from that 
moment.</p>
<p>Lady Mottisfont, too, was in a wretched mood all the way home 
that day.&nbsp; The Countess was so charming in every way that 
she had charmed her gentle ladyship; how should it be possible 
that she had failed to charm Sir Ashley?&nbsp; Moreover, she had 
awakened a strange thought in Philippa&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; As 
soon as she reached home she rushed to the nursery, and there, 
seizing Dorothy, frantically kissed her; then, holding her at 
arm&rsquo;s length, she gazed with a piercing inquisitiveness 
into the girl&rsquo;s lineaments.&nbsp; She sighed deeply, 
abandoned the wondering Dorothy, and hastened away.</p>
<p>She had seen there not only her husband&rsquo;s traits, which 
she had often beheld before, but others, of the shade, shape, and
expression which characterized those of her new neighbour.</p>
<p>Then this poor lady perceived the whole perturbing sequence of
things, and asked herself how she could have been such a walking 
piece of simplicity as not to have thought of this before.&nbsp; 
But she did not stay long upbraiding herself for her 
shortsightedness, so overwhelmed was she with misery at the 
spectacle of herself as an intruder between these.&nbsp; To be 
sure she could not have foreseen such a conjuncture; but that did
not lessen her grief.&nbsp; The woman who had been both her 
husband&rsquo;s bliss and his backsliding had reappeared free 
when he was no longer so, and she evidently was dying to claim 
her own in the person of Dorothy, who had meanwhile grown to be, 
to Lady Mottisfont, almost the only source of each day&rsquo;s 
happiness, supplying her with something to watch over, inspiring 
her with the sense of maternity, and so largely reflecting her 
husband&rsquo;s nature as almost to deceive her into the pleasant
belief that she reflected her own also.</p>
<p>If there was a single direction in which this devoted and 
virtuous lady erred, it was in the direction of 
over-submissiveness.&nbsp; When all is said and done, and the 
truth told, men seldom show much self-sacrifice in their conduct 
as lords and masters to helpless women bound to them for life, 
and perhaps (though I say it with all uncertainty) if she had 
blazed up in his face like a furze-faggot, directly he came home,
she might have helped herself a little.&nbsp; But God knows 
whether this is a true supposition; at any rate she did no such 
thing; and waited and prayed that she might never do despite to 
him who, she was bound to admit, had always been tender and 
courteous towards her; and hoped that little Dorothy might never 
be taken away.</p>
<p>By degrees the two households became friendly, and very seldom
did a week pass without their seeing something of each 
other.&nbsp; Try as she might, and dangerous as she assumed the 
acquaintanceship to be, Lady Mottisfont could detect no fault or 
flaw in her new friend.&nbsp; It was obvious that Dorothy had 
been the magnet which had drawn the Contessa hither, and not Sir 
Ashley.</p>
<p>Such beauty, united with such understanding and brightness, 
Philippa had never before known in one of her own sex, and she 
tried to think (whether she succeeded I do not know) that she did
not mind the propinquity; since a woman so rich, so fair, and 
with such a command of suitors, could not desire to wreck the 
happiness of so inoffensive a person as herself.</p>
<p>The season drew on when it was the custom for families of 
distinction to go off to The Bath, and Sir Ashley Mottisfont 
persuaded his wife to accompany him thither with Dorothy.&nbsp; 
Everybody of any note was there this year.&nbsp; From their own 
part of England came many that they knew; among the rest, Lord 
and Lady Purbeck, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, Sir John 
Grebe, the Drenkhards, Lady Stourvale, the old Duke of 
Hamptonshire, the Bishop of Melchester, the Dean of Exonbury, and
other lesser lights of Court, pulpit, and field.&nbsp; Thither 
also came the fair Contessa, whom, as soon as Philippa saw how 
much she was sought after by younger men, she could not 
conscientiously suspect of renewed designs upon Sir Ashley.</p>
<p>But the Countess had finer opportunities than ever with 
Dorothy; for Lady Mottisfont was often indisposed, and even at 
other times could not honestly hinder an intercourse which gave 
bright ideas to the child.&nbsp; Dorothy welcomed her new 
acquaintance with a strange and instinctive readiness that 
intimated the wonderful subtlety of the threads which bind flesh 
and flesh together.</p>
<p>At last the crisis came: it was precipitated by an 
accident.&nbsp; Dorothy and her nurse had gone out one day for an
airing, leaving Lady Mottisfont alone indoors.&nbsp; While she 
sat gloomily thinking that in all likelihood the Countess would 
contrive to meet the child somewhere, and exchange a few tender 
words with her, Sir Ashley Mottisfont rushed in and informed her 
that Dorothy had just had the narrowest possible escape from 
death.&nbsp; Some workmen were undermining a house to pull it 
down for rebuilding, when, without warning, the front wall 
inclined slowly outwards for its fall, the nurse and child 
passing beneath it at the same moment.&nbsp; The fall was 
temporarily arrested by the scaffolding, while in the meantime 
the Countess had witnessed their imminent danger from the other 
side of the street.&nbsp; Springing across, she snatched Dorothy 
from under the wall, and pulled the nurse after her, the middle 
of the way being barely reached before they were enveloped in the
dense dust of the descending mass, though not a stone touched 
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is Dorothy?&rsquo; says the excited Lady 
Mottisfont.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has her&mdash;she won&rsquo;t let her go for a 
time&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has her?&nbsp; But she&rsquo;s 
<i>mine</i>&mdash;she&rsquo;s mine!&rsquo; cries Lady 
Mottisfont.</p>
<p>Then her quick and tender eyes perceived that her husband had 
almost forgotten her intrusive existence in contemplating the 
oneness of Dorothy&rsquo;s, the Countess&rsquo;s, and his own: he
was in a dream of exaltation which recognized nothing necessary 
to his well-being outside that welded circle of three lives.</p>
<p>Dorothy was at length brought home; she was much fascinated by
the Countess, and saw nothing tragic, but rather all that was 
truly delightful, in what had happened.&nbsp; In the evening, 
when the excitement was over, and Dorothy was put to bed, Sir 
Ashley said, &lsquo;She has saved Dorothy; and I have been asking
myself what I can do for her as a slight acknowledgment of her 
heroism.&nbsp; Surely we ought to let her have Dorothy to bring 
up, since she still desires to do it?&nbsp; It would be so much 
to Dorothy&rsquo;s advantage.&nbsp; We ought to look at it in 
that light, and not selfishly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Philippa seized his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ashley, Ashley!&nbsp; 
You don&rsquo;t mean it&mdash;that I must lose my pretty 
darling&mdash;the only one I have?&rsquo;&nbsp; She met his gaze 
with her piteous mouth and wet eyes so painfully strained, that 
he turned away his face.</p>
<p>The next morning, before Dorothy was awake, Lady Mottisfont 
stole to the girl&rsquo;s bedside, and sat regarding her.&nbsp; 
When Dorothy opened her eyes, she fixed them for a long time upon
Philippa&rsquo;s features.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mamma&mdash;you are not so pretty as the Contessa, are 
you?&rsquo; she said at length.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not, Dorothy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why are you not, mamma?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dorothy&mdash;where would you rather live, always; with
me, or with her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The little girl looked troubled.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sorry, 
mamma; I don&rsquo;t mean to be unkind; but I would rather live 
with her; I mean, if I might without trouble, and you did not 
mind, and it could be just the same to us all, you 
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has she ever asked you the same question?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, mamma.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There lay the sting of it: the Countess seemed the soul of 
honour and fairness in this matter, test her as she might.&nbsp; 
That afternoon Lady Mottisfont went to her husband with singular 
firmness upon her gentle face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ashley, we have been married nearly five years, and I 
have never challenged you with what I know perfectly 
well&mdash;the parentage of Dorothy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never have you, Philippa dear.&nbsp; Though I have seen
that you knew from the first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From the first as to her father, not as to her 
mother.&nbsp; Her I did not know for some time; but I know 
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! you have discovered that too?&rsquo; says he, 
without much surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Could I help it?&nbsp; Very well, that being so, I have
thought it over; and I have spoken to Dorothy.&nbsp; I agree to 
her going.&nbsp; I can do no less than grant to the Countess her 
wish, after her kindness to 
my&mdash;your&mdash;her&mdash;child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then this self-sacrificing woman went hastily away that he 
might not see that her heart was bursting; and thereupon, before 
they left the city, Dorothy changed her mother and her 
home.&nbsp; After this, the Countess went away to London for a 
while, taking Dorothy with her; and the baronet and his wife 
returned to their lonely place at Deansleigh Park without 
her.</p>
<p>To renounce Dorothy in the bustle of Bath was a different 
thing from living without her in this quiet home.&nbsp; One 
evening Sir Ashley missed his wife from the supper-table; her 
manner had been so pensive and woeful of late that he immediately
became alarmed.&nbsp; He said nothing, but looked about outside 
the house narrowly, and discerned her form in the park, where 
recently she had been accustomed to walk alone.&nbsp; In its 
lower levels there was a pool fed by a trickling brook, and he 
reached this spot in time to hear a splash.&nbsp; Running 
forward, he dimly perceived her light gown floating in the 
water.&nbsp; To pull her out was the work of a few instants, and 
bearing her indoors to her room, he undressed her, nobody in the 
house knowing of the incident but himself.&nbsp; She had not been
immersed long enough to lose her senses, and soon 
recovered.&nbsp; She owned that she had done it because the 
Contessa had taken away her child, as she persisted in calling 
Dorothy.&nbsp; Her husband spoke sternly to her, and impressed 
upon her the weakness of giving way thus, when all that had 
happened was for the best.&nbsp; She took his reproof meekly, and
admitted her fault.</p>
<p>After that she became more resigned, but he often caught her 
in tears over some doll, shoe, or ribbon of Dorothy&rsquo;s, and 
decided to take her to the North of England for change of air and
scene.&nbsp; This was not without its beneficial effect, 
corporeally no less than mentally, as later events showed, but 
she still evinced a preternatural sharpness of ear at the most 
casual mention of the child.&nbsp; When they reached home, the 
Countess and Dorothy were still absent from the neighbouring 
Fernell Hall, but in a month or two they returned, and a little 
later Sir Ashley Mottisfont came into his wife&rsquo;s room full 
of news.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;would you think it, Philippa!&nbsp; After 
being so desperate, too, about getting Dorothy to be with 
her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our neighbour, the Countess, is going to be married 
again!&nbsp; It is to somebody she has met in London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Mottisfont was much surprised; she had never dreamt of 
such an event.&nbsp; The conflict for the possession of 
Dorothy&rsquo;s person had obscured the possibility of it; yet 
what more likely, the Countess being still under thirty, and so 
good-looking?</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is of still more interest to us, or to you,&rsquo;
continued her husband, &lsquo;is a kind offer she has made.&nbsp;
She is willing that you should have Dorothy back again.&nbsp; 
Seeing what a grief the loss of her has been to you, she will try
to do without her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not for that; it is not to oblige me,&rsquo; said
Lady Mottisfont quickly.&nbsp; &lsquo;One can see well enough 
what it is for!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, never mind; beggars mustn&rsquo;t be 
choosers.&nbsp; The reason or motive is nothing to us, so that 
you obtain your desire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not a beggar any longer,&rsquo; said Lady 
Mottisfont, with proud mystery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean by that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Mottisfont hesitated.&nbsp; However, it was only too 
plain that she did not now jump at a restitution of one for whom 
some months before she had been breaking her heart.</p>
<p>The explanation of this change of mood became apparent some 
little time farther on.&nbsp; Lady Mottisfont, after five years 
of wedded life, was expecting to become a mother, and the aspect 
of many things was greatly altered in her view.&nbsp; Among the 
more important changes was that of no longer feeling Dorothy to 
be absolutely indispensable to her existence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in view of her coming marriage, the Countess 
decided to abandon the remainder of her term at Fernell Hall, and
return to her pretty little house in town.&nbsp; But she could 
not do this quite so quickly as she had expected, and half a year
or more elapsed before she finally quitted the neighbourhood, the
interval being passed in alternations between the country and 
London.&nbsp; Prior to her last departure she had an interview 
with Sir Ashley Mottisfont, and it occurred three days after his 
wife had presented him with a son and heir.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wanted to speak to you,&rsquo; said the Countess, 
looking him luminously in the face, &lsquo;about the dear 
foundling I have adopted temporarily, and thought to have adopted
permanently.&nbsp; But my marriage makes it too risky!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought it might be that,&rsquo; he answered, 
regarding her steadfastly back again, and observing two tears 
come slowly into her eyes as she heard her own voice describe 
Dorothy in those words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t criticize me,&rsquo; she said hastily; and 
recovering herself, went on.&nbsp; &lsquo;If Lady Mottisfont 
could take her back again, as I suggested, it would be better for
me, and certainly no worse for Dorothy.&nbsp; To every one but 
ourselves she is but a child I have taken a fancy to, and Lady 
Mottisfont coveted her so much, and was very reluctant to let her
go . . . I am sure she will adopt her again?&rsquo; she added 
anxiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will sound her afresh,&rsquo; said the baronet.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You leave Dorothy behind for the present?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; although I go away, I do not give up the house for
another month.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did not speak to his wife about the proposal till some few 
days after, when Lady Mottisfont had nearly recovered, and news 
of the Countess&rsquo;s marriage in London had just reached 
them.&nbsp; He had no sooner mentioned Dorothy&rsquo;s name than 
Lady Mottisfont showed symptoms of disquietude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not acquired any dislike of Dorothy,&rsquo; she 
said, &lsquo;but I feel that there is one nearer to me now.&nbsp;
Dorothy chose the alternative of going to the Countess, you must 
remember, when I put it to her as between the Countess and 
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, my dear Philippa, how can you argue thus about a 
child, and that child our Dorothy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not <i>ours</i>,&rsquo; said his wife, pointing to the 
cot.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ours is here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, then, Philippa,&rsquo; he said, surprised, 
&lsquo;you won&rsquo;t have her back, after nearly dying of grief
at the loss of her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot argue, dear Ashley.&nbsp; I should prefer not 
to have the responsibility of Dorothy again.&nbsp; Her place is 
filled now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her husband sighed, and went out of the chamber.&nbsp; There 
had been a previous arrangement that Dorothy should be brought to
the house on a visit that day, but instead of taking her up to 
his wife, he did not inform Lady Mottisfont of the child&rsquo;s 
presence.&nbsp; He entertained her himself as well as he could, 
and accompanied her into the park, where they had a ramble 
together.&nbsp; Presently he sat down on the root of an elm and 
took her upon his knee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Between this husband and this baby, little Dorothy, you
who had two homes are left out in the cold,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t I go to London with my pretty mamma?&rsquo;
said Dorothy, perceiving from his manner that there was a hitch 
somewhere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid not, my child.&nbsp; She only took you to 
live with her because she was lonely, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then can&rsquo;t I stay at Deansleigh Park with my 
other mamma and you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid that cannot be done either,&rsquo; said he 
sadly.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have a baby in the house now.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He closed the reply by stooping down and kissing her, there being
a tear in his eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then nobody wants me!&rsquo; said Dorothy 
pathetically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, somebody wants you,&rsquo; he assured 
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where would you like to live 
besides?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy&rsquo;s experiences being rather limited, she 
mentioned the only other place in the world that she was 
acquainted with, the cottage of the villager who had taken care 
of her before Lady Mottisfont had removed her to the Manor 
House.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll be best off and 
most independent,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll
come to see you, my dear girl, and bring you pretty things; and 
perhaps you&rsquo;ll be just as happy there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when the change came, and Dorothy was handed 
over to the kind cottage-woman, the poor child missed the 
luxurious roominess of Fernell Hall and Deansleigh; and for a 
long time her little feet, which had been accustomed to carpets 
and oak floors, suffered from the cold of the stone flags on 
which it was now her lot to live and to play; while chilblains 
came upon her fingers with washing at the pump.&nbsp; But thicker
shoes with nails in them somewhat remedied the cold feet, and her
complaints and tears on this and other scores diminished to 
silence as she became inured anew to the hardships of the 
farm-cottage, and she grew up robust if not handsome.&nbsp; She 
was never altogether lost sight of by Sir Ashley, though she was 
deprived of the systematic education which had been devised and 
begun for her by Lady Mottisfont, as well as by her other mamma, 
the enthusiastic Countess.&nbsp; The latter soon had other 
Dorothys to think of, who occupied her time and affection as 
fully as Lady Mottisfont&rsquo;s were occupied by her precious 
boy.&nbsp; In the course of time the doubly-desired and 
doubly-rejected Dorothy married, I believe, a respectable 
road-contractor&mdash;the same, if I mistake not, who repaired 
and improved the old highway running from Wintoncester 
south-westerly through the New Forest&mdash;and in the heart of 
this worthy man of business the poor girl found the nest which 
had been denied her by her own flesh and blood of higher 
degree.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Several of the listeners wished to hear another story from the
sentimental member after this, but he said that he could recall 
nothing else at the moment, and that it seemed to him as if his 
friend on the other side of the fireplace had something to say 
from the look of his face.</p>
<p>The member alluded to was a respectable churchwarden, with a 
sly chink to one eyelid&mdash;possibly the result of an 
accident&mdash;and a regular attendant at the Club 
meetings.&nbsp; He replied that his looks had been mainly caused 
by his interest in the two ladies of the last story, apparently 
women of strong motherly instincts, even though they were not 
genuinely staunch in their tenderness.&nbsp; The tale had brought
to his mind an instance of a firmer affection of that sort on the
paternal side, in a nature otherwise culpable.&nbsp; As for 
telling the story, his manner was much against him, he feared; 
but he would do his best, if they wished.</p>
<p>Here the President interposed with a suggestion that as it was
getting late in the afternoon it would be as well to adjourn to 
their respective inns and lodgings for dinner, after which those 
who cared to do so could return and resume these curious domestic
traditions for the remainder of the evening, which might 
otherwise prove irksome enough.&nbsp; The curator had told him 
that the room was at their service.&nbsp; The churchwarden, who 
was beginning to feel hungry himself, readily acquiesced, and the
Club separated for an hour and a half.&nbsp; Then the faithful 
ones began to drop in again&mdash;among whom were not the 
President; neither came the rural dean, nor the two curates, 
though the Colonel, and the man of family, cigars in mouth, were 
good enough to return, having found their hotel dreary.&nbsp; The
museum had no regular means of illumination, and a solitary 
candle, less powerful than the rays of the fire, was placed on 
the table; also bottles and glasses, provided by some thoughtful 
member.&nbsp; The chink-eyed churchwarden, now thoroughly primed,
proceeded to relate in his own terms what was in substance as 
follows, while many of his listeners smoked.</p>
<h2>DAME THE FIFTH&mdash;THE LADY ICENWAY<br />
By the Churchwarden</h2>
<p>In the reign of His Most Excellent Majesty King George the 
Third, Defender of the Faith and of the American Colonies, there 
lived in &lsquo;a faire maner-place&rsquo; (so Leland called it 
in his day, as I have been told), in one o&rsquo; the greenest 
bits of woodland between Bristol and the city of Exonbury, a 
young lady who resembled some aforesaid ones in having many 
talents and exceeding great beauty.&nbsp; With these gifts she 
combined a somewhat imperious temper and arbitrary mind, though 
her experience of the world was not actually so large as her 
conclusive manner would have led the stranger to suppose.&nbsp; 
Being an orphan, she resided with her uncle, who, though he was 
fairly considerate as to her welfare, left her pretty much to 
herself.</p>
<p>Now it chanced that when this lovely young lady was about 
nineteen, she (being a fearless horsewoman) was riding, with only
a young lad as an attendant, in one o&rsquo; the woods near her 
uncle&rsquo;s house, and, in trotting along, her horse stumbled 
over the root of a felled tree.&nbsp; She slipped to the ground, 
not seriously hurt, and was assisted home by a gentleman who came
in view at the moment of her mishap.&nbsp; It turned out that 
this gentleman, a total stranger to her, was on a visit at the 
house of a neighbouring landowner.&nbsp; He was of Dutch 
extraction, and occasionally came to England on business or 
pleasure from his plantations in Guiana, on the north coast of 
South America, where he usually resided.</p>
<p>On this account he was naturally but little known in Wessex, 
and was but a slight acquaintance of the gentleman at whose 
mansion he was a guest.&nbsp; However, the friendship between him
and the Heymeres&mdash;as the uncle and niece were 
named&mdash;warmed and warmed by degrees, there being but few 
folk o&rsquo; note in the vicinity at that time, which made a 
newcomer, if he were at all sociable and of good credit, always 
sure of a welcome.&nbsp; A tender feeling (as it is called by the
romantic) sprang up between the two young people, which ripened 
into intimacy.&nbsp; Anderling, the foreign gentleman, was of an 
amorous temperament; and, though he endeavoured to conceal his 
feeling, it could be seen that Miss Maria Heymere had impressed 
him rather more deeply than would be represented by a scratch 
upon a stone.&nbsp; He seemed absolutely unable to free himself 
from her fascination; and his inability to do so, much as he 
tried&mdash;evidently thinking he had not the ghost of a chance 
with her&mdash;gave her the pleasure of power; though she more 
than sympathized when she overheard him heaving his deep drawn 
sighs&mdash;privately to himself, as he supposed.</p>
<p>After prolonging his visit by every conceivable excuse in his 
power, he summoned courage, and offered her his hand and his 
heart.&nbsp; Being in no way disinclined to him, though not so 
fervid as he, and her uncle making no objection to the match, she
consented to share his fate, for better or otherwise, in the 
distant colony where, as he assured her, his rice, and coffee, 
and maize, and timber, produced him ample means&mdash;a statement
which was borne out by his friend, her uncle&rsquo;s 
neighbour.&nbsp; In short, a day for their marriage was fixed, 
earlier in the engagement than is usual or desirable between 
comparative strangers, by reason of the necessity he was under of
returning to look after his properties.</p>
<p>The wedding took place, and Maria left her uncle&rsquo;s 
mansion with her husband, going in the first place to London, and
about a fortnight after sailing with him across the great ocean 
for their distant home&mdash;which, however, he assured her, 
should not be her home for long, it being his intention to 
dispose of his interests in this part of the world as soon as the
war was over, and he could do so advantageously; when they could 
come to Europe, and reside in some favourite capital.</p>
<p>As they advanced on the voyage she observed that he grew more 
and more constrained; and, by the time they had crossed the Line,
he was quite depressed, just as he had been before proposing to 
her.&nbsp; A day or two before landing at Paramaribo, he embraced
her in a very tearful and passionate manner, and said he wished 
to make a confession.&nbsp; It had been his misfortune, he said, 
to marry at Quebec in early life a woman whose reputation proved 
to be in every way bad and scandalous.&nbsp; The discovery had 
nearly killed him; but he had ultimately separated from her, and 
had never seen her since.&nbsp; He had hoped and prayed she might
be dead; but recently in London, when they were starting on this 
journey, he had discovered that she was still alive.&nbsp; At 
first he had decided to keep this dark intelligence from her 
beloved ears; but he had felt that he could not do it.&nbsp; All 
he hoped was that such a condition of things would make no 
difference in her feelings for him, as it need make no difference
in the course of their lives.</p>
<p>Thereupon the spirit of this proud and masterful lady showed 
itself in violent turmoil, like the raging of a nor&rsquo;-west 
thunderstorm&mdash;as well it might, God knows.&nbsp; But she was
of too stout a nature to be broken down by his revelation, as 
many ladies of my acquaintance would have been&mdash;so far from 
home, and right under the Line in the blaze o&rsquo; the 
sun.&nbsp; Of the two, indeed, he was the more wretched and 
shattered in spirit, for he loved her deeply, and (there being a 
foreign twist in his make) had been tempted to this crime by her 
exceeding beauty, against which he had struggled day and night, 
till he had no further resistance left in him.&nbsp; It was she 
who came first to a decision as to what should be 
done&mdash;whether a wise one I do not attempt to judge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I put it to you,&rsquo; says she, when many useless 
self-reproaches and protestations on his part had been 
uttered&mdash;&lsquo;I put it to you whether, if any manliness is
left in you, you ought not to do exactly what I consider the best
thing for me in this strait to which you have reduced 
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He promised to do anything in the whole world.&nbsp; She then 
requested him to allow her to return, and announce him as having 
died of malignant ague immediately on their arrival at 
Paramaribo; that she should consequently appear in weeds as his 
widow in her native place; and that he would never molest her, or
come again to that part of the world during the whole course of 
his life&mdash;a good reason for which would be that the legal 
consequences might be serious.</p>
<p>He readily acquiesced in this, as he would have acquiesced in 
anything for the restitution of one he adored so 
deeply&mdash;even to the yielding of life itself.&nbsp; To put 
her in an immediate state of independence he gave her, in bonds 
and jewels, a considerable sum (for his worldly means had been in
no way exaggerated); and by the next ship she sailed again for 
England, having travelled no farther than to Paramaribo.&nbsp; At
parting he declared it to be his intention to turn all his landed
possessions into personal property, and to be a wanderer on the 
face of the earth in remorse for his conduct towards her.</p>
<p>Maria duly arrived in England, and immediately on landing 
apprised her uncle of her return, duly appearing at his house in 
the garb of a widow.&nbsp; She was commiserated by all the 
neighbours as soon as her story was told; but only to her uncle 
did she reveal the real state of affairs, and her reason for 
concealing it.&nbsp; For, though she had been innocent of wrong, 
Maria&rsquo;s pride was of that grain which could not brook the 
least appearance of having been fooled, or deluded, or nonplussed
in her worldly aims.</p>
<p>For some time she led a quiet life with her relative, and in 
due course a son was born to her.&nbsp; She was much respected 
for her dignity and reserve, and the portable wealth which her 
temporary husband had made over to her enabled her to live in 
comfort in a wing of the mansion, without assistance from her 
uncle at all.&nbsp; But, knowing that she was not what she seemed
to be, her life was an uneasy one, and she often said to herself:
&lsquo;Suppose his continued existence should become known here, 
and people should discern the pride of my motive in hiding my 
humiliation?&nbsp; It would be worse than if I had been frank at 
first, which I should have been but for the credit of this 
child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such grave reflections as these occupied her with increasing 
force; and during their continuance she encountered a worthy man 
of noble birth and title&mdash;Lord Icenway his name&mdash;whose 
seat was beyond Wintoncester, quite at t&rsquo;other end of 
Wessex.&nbsp; He being anxious to pay his addresses to her, Maria
willingly accepted them, though he was a plain man, older than 
herself; for she discerned in a re-marriage a method of 
fortifying her position against mortifying discoveries.&nbsp; In 
a few months their union took place, and Maria lifted her head as
Lady Icenway, and left with her husband and child for his home as
aforesaid, where she was quite unknown.</p>
<p>A justification, or a condemnation, of her step (according as 
you view it) was seen when, not long after, she received a note 
from her former husband Anderling.&nbsp; It was a hasty and 
tender epistle, and perhaps it was fortunate that it arrived 
during the temporary absence of Lord Icenway.&nbsp; His worthless
wife, said Anderling, had just died in Quebec; he had gone there 
to ascertain particulars, and had seen the unfortunate woman 
buried.&nbsp; He now was hastening to England to repair the wrong
he had done his Maria.&nbsp; He asked her to meet him at 
Southampton, his port of arrival; which she need be in no fear of
doing, as he had changed his name, and was almost absolutely 
unknown in Europe.&nbsp; He would remarry her immediately, and 
live with her in any part of the Continent, as they had 
originally intended, where, for the great love he still bore her,
he would devote himself to her service for the rest of his 
days.</p>
<p>Lady Icenway, self-possessed as it was her nature to be, was 
yet much disturbed at this news, and set off to meet him, 
unattended, as soon as she heard that the ship was in 
sight.&nbsp; As soon as they stood face to face she found that 
she still possessed all her old influence over him, though his 
power to fascinate her had quite departed.&nbsp; In his sorrow 
for his offence against her, he had become a man of strict 
religious habits, self-denying as a lenten saint, though formerly
he had been a free and joyous liver.&nbsp; Having first got him 
to swear to make her any amends she should choose (which he was 
imagining must be by a true marriage), she informed him that she 
had already wedded another husband, an excellent man of ancient 
family and possessions, who had given her a title, in which she 
much rejoiced.</p>
<p>At this the countenance of the poor foreign gentleman became 
cold as clay, and his heart withered within him; for as it had 
been her beauty and bearing which had led him to sin to obtain 
her, so, now that her beauty was in fuller bloom, and her manner 
more haughty by her success, did he feel her fascination to be 
almost more than he could bear.&nbsp; Nevertheless, having sworn 
his word, he undertook to obey her commands, which were simply a 
renewal of her old request&mdash;that he would depart for some 
foreign country, and never reveal his existence to her friends, 
or husband, or any person in England; never trouble her more, 
seeing how great a harm it would do her in the high position 
which she at present occupied.</p>
<p>He bowed his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;And the child&mdash;our 
child?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is well,&rsquo; says she.&nbsp; &lsquo;Quite 
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With this the unhappy gentleman departed, much sadder in his 
heart than on his voyage to England; for it had never occurred to
him that a woman who rated her honour so highly as Maria had 
done, and who was the mother of a child of his, would have 
adopted such means as this for the restoration of that honour, 
and at so surprisingly early a date.&nbsp; He had fully 
calculated on making her his wife in law and truth, and of living
in cheerful unity with her and his offspring, for whom he felt a 
deep and growing tenderness, though he had never once seen the 
child.</p>
<p>The lady returned to her mansion beyond Wintoncester, and told
nothing of the interview to her noble husband, who had 
fortunately gone that day to do a little cocking and ratting out 
by Weydon Priors, and knew nothing of her movements.&nbsp; She 
had dismissed her poor Anderling peremptorily enough; yet she 
would often after this look in the face of the child of her 
so-called widowhood, to discover what and how many traits of his 
father were to be seen in his lineaments.&nbsp; For this she had 
ample opportunity during the following autumn and winter months, 
her husband being a matter-of-fact nobleman, who spent the 
greater part of his time in field-sports and agriculture.</p>
<p>One winter day, when he had started for a meet of the hounds a
long way from the house&mdash;it being his custom to hunt three 
or four times a week at this season of the year&mdash;she had 
walked into the sunshine upon the terrace before the windows, 
where there fell at her feet some little white object that had 
come over a boundary wall hard by.&nbsp; It proved to be a tiny 
note wrapped round a stone.&nbsp; Lady Icenway opened it and read
it, and immediately (no doubt, with a stern fixture of her 
queenly countenance) walked hastily along the terrace, and 
through the door into the shrubbery, whence the note had 
come.&nbsp; The man who had first married her stood under the 
bushes before her.&nbsp; It was plain from his appearance that 
something had gone wrong with him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You notice a change in me, my best-beloved,&rsquo; he 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, Maria&mdash;I have lost all the wealth I 
once possessed&mdash;mainly by reckless gambling in the 
Continental hells to which you banished me.&nbsp; But one thing 
in the world remains to me&mdash;the child&mdash;and it is for 
him that I have intruded here.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t fear me, 
darling!&nbsp; I shall not inconvenience you long; I love you too
well!&nbsp; But I think of the boy day and night&mdash;I cannot 
help it&mdash;I cannot keep my feeling for him down; and I long 
to see him, and speak a word to him once in my 
lifetime!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But your oath?&rsquo; says she.&nbsp; &lsquo;You 
promised never to reveal by word or sign&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will reveal nothing.&nbsp; Only let me see the 
child.&nbsp; I know what I have sworn to you, cruel mistress, and
I respect my oath.&nbsp; Otherwise I might have seen him by some 
subterfuge.&nbsp; But I preferred the frank course of asking your
permission.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She demurred, with the haughty severity which had grown part 
of her character, and which her elevation to the rank of a 
peeress had rather intensified than diminished.&nbsp; She said 
that she would consider, and would give him an answer the day 
after the next, at the same hour and place, when her husband 
would again be absent with his pack of hounds.</p>
<p>The gentleman waited patiently.&nbsp; Lady Icenway, who had 
now no conscious love left for him, well considered the matter, 
and felt that it would be advisable not to push to extremes a man
of so passionate a heart.&nbsp; On the day and hour she met him 
as she had promised to do.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shall see him,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;of course on
the strict condition that you do not reveal yourself, and hence, 
though you see him, he must not see you, or your manner might 
betray you and me.&nbsp; I will lull him into a nap in the 
afternoon, and then I will come to you here, and fetch you 
indoors by a private way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The unfortunate father, whose misdemeanour had recoiled upon 
his own head in a way he could not have foreseen, promised to 
adhere to her instructions, and waited in the shrubberies till 
the moment when she should call him.&nbsp; This she duly did 
about three o&rsquo;clock that day, leading him in by a garden 
door, and upstairs to the nursery where the child lay.&nbsp; He 
was in his little cot, breathing calmly, his arm thrown over his 
head, and his silken curls crushed into the pillow.&nbsp; His 
father, now almost to be pitied, bent over him, and a tear from 
his eye wetted the coverlet.</p>
<p>She held up a warning finger as he lowered his mouth to the 
lips of the boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But oh, why not?&rsquo; implored he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, then,&rsquo; said she, relenting.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;But as gently as possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He kissed the child without waking him, turned, gave him a 
last look, and followed her out of the chamber, when she 
conducted him off the premises by the way he had come.</p>
<p>But this remedy for his sadness of heart at being a stranger 
to his own son, had the effect of intensifying the malady; for 
while originally, not knowing or having ever seen the boy, he had
loved him vaguely and imaginatively only, he now became attached 
to him in flesh and bone, as any parent might; and the feeling 
that he could at best only see his child at the rarest and most 
cursory moments, if at all, drove him into a state of distraction
which threatened to overthrow his promise to the boy&rsquo;s 
mother to keep out of his sight.</p>
<p>But such was his chivalrous respect for Lady Icenway, and his 
regret at having ever deceived her, that he schooled his poor 
heart into submission.&nbsp; Owing to his loneliness, all the 
fervour of which he was capable&mdash;and that was 
much&mdash;flowed now in the channel of parental and marital 
love&mdash;for a child who did not know him, and a woman who had 
ceased to love him.</p>
<p>At length this singular punishment became such a torture to 
the poor foreigner that he resolved to lessen it at all hazards, 
compatible with punctilious care for the name of the lady his 
former wife, to whom his attachment seemed to increase in 
proportion to her punitive treatment of him.&nbsp; At one time of
his life he had taken great interest in tulip-culture, as well as
gardening in general; and since the ruin of his fortunes, and his
arrival in England, he had made of his knowledge a precarious 
income in the hot-houses of nurserymen and others.&nbsp; With the
new idea in his head he applied himself zealously to the 
business, till he acquired in a few months great skill in 
horticulture.&nbsp; Waiting till the noble lord, his lady&rsquo;s
husband, had room for an under-gardener of a general sort, he 
offered himself for the place, and was engaged immediately by 
reason of his civility and intelligence, before Lady Icenway knew
anything of the matter.&nbsp; Much therefore did he surprise her 
when she found him in the conservatories of her mansion a week or
two after his arrival.&nbsp; The punishment of instant dismissal,
with which at first she haughtily threatened him, my lady thought
fit, on reflection, not to enforce.&nbsp; While he served her 
thus she knew he would not harm her by a word, while, if he were 
expelled, chagrin might induce him to reveal in a moment of 
exasperation what kind treatment would assist him to conceal.</p>
<p>So he was allowed to remain on the premises, and had for his 
residence a little cottage by the garden-wall which had been the 
domicile of some of his predecessors in the same 
occupation.&nbsp; Here he lived absolutely alone, and spent much 
of his leisure in reading, but the greater part in watching the 
windows and lawns of his lady&rsquo;s house for glimpses of the 
form of the child.&nbsp; It was for that child&rsquo;s sake that 
he abandoned the tenets of the Roman Catholic Church in which he 
had been reared, and became the most regular attendant at the 
services in the parish place of worship hard by, where, sitting 
behind the pew of my lady, my lord, and his stepson, the gardener
could pensively study the traits and movements of the youngster 
at only a few feet distance, without suspicion or hindrance.</p>
<p>He filled his post for more than two years with a pleasure to 
himself which, though mournful, was soothing, his lady never 
forgiving him, or allowing him to be anything more than 
&lsquo;the gardener&rsquo; to her child, though once or twice the
boy said, &lsquo;That gardener&rsquo;s eyes are so sad!&nbsp; Why
does he look so sadly at me?&rsquo;&nbsp; He sunned himself in 
her scornfulness as if it were love, and his ears drank in her 
curt monosyllables as though they were rhapsodies of 
endearment.&nbsp; Strangely enough, the coldness with which she 
treated her foreigner began to be the conduct of Lord Icenway 
towards herself.&nbsp; It was a matter of great anxiety to him 
that there should be a lineal successor to the title, yet no sign
of that successor appeared.&nbsp; One day he complained to her 
quite roughly of his fate.&nbsp; &lsquo;All will go to that dolt 
of a cousin!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d sooner see 
my name and place at the bottom of the sea!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The lady soothed him and fell into thought, and did not 
recriminate.&nbsp; But one day, soon after, she went down to the 
cottage of the gardener to inquire how he was getting on, for he 
had been ailing of late, though, as was supposed, not 
seriously.&nbsp; Though she often visited the poor, she had never
entered her under-gardener&rsquo;s home before, and was much 
surprised&mdash;even grieved and dismayed&mdash;to find that he 
was too ill to rise from his bed.&nbsp; She went back to her 
mansion and returned with some delicate soup, that she might have
a reason for seeing him.</p>
<p>His condition was so feeble and alarming, and his face so 
thin, that it quite shocked her softening heart, and gazing upon 
him she said, &lsquo;You must get well&mdash;you must!&nbsp; I 
have been hard with you&mdash;I know it.&nbsp; I will not be so 
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sick and dying man&mdash;for he was dying 
indeed&mdash;took her hand and pressed it to his lips.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Too late, my darling, too late!&rsquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you <i>must not</i> die!&nbsp; Oh, you must 
not!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; And on an impulse she bent down and 
whispered some words to him, blushing as she had blushed in her 
maiden days.</p>
<p>He replied by a faint wan smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;Time was! . . . 
but that&rsquo;s past!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I must 
die!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And die he did, a few days later, as the sun was going down 
behind the garden-wall.&nbsp; Her harshness seemed to come trebly
home to her then, and she remorsefully exclaimed against herself 
in secret and alone.&nbsp; Her one desire now was to erect some 
tribute to his memory, without its being recognized as her 
handiwork.&nbsp; In the completion of this scheme there arrived a
few months later a handsome stained-glass window for the church; 
and when it was unpacked and in course of erection Lord Icenway 
strolled into the building with his wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;<i>Erected to his memory by his grieving 
widow</i>,&rdquo;&rsquo; he said, reading the legend on the 
glass.&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that he had a wife; 
I&rsquo;ve never seen her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, you must have, Icenway; only you forget,&rsquo;
replied his lady blandly.&nbsp; &lsquo;But she didn&rsquo;t live 
with him, and was seldom seen visiting him, because there were 
differences between them; which, as is usually the case, makes 
her all the more sorry now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And go ruining herself by this expensive ruby-and-azure
glass-design.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is not poor, they say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Lord Icenway grew older he became crustier and crustier, 
and whenever he set eyes on his wife&rsquo;s boy by her other 
husband he would burst out morosely, saying,</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a very odd thing, my lady, that you could 
oblige your first husband, and couldn&rsquo;t oblige 
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! if I had only thought of it sooner!&rsquo; she 
murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing, dearest,&rsquo; replied Lady Icenway.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The Colonel was the first to comment upon the 
Churchwarden&rsquo;s tale, by saying that the fate of the poor 
fellow was rather a hard one.</p>
<p>The gentleman-tradesman could not see that his fate was at all
too hard for him.&nbsp; He was legally nothing to her, and he had
served her shamefully.&nbsp; If he had been really her husband it
would have stood differently.</p>
<p>The Bookworm remarked that Lord Icenway seemed to have been a 
very unsuspicious man, with which view a fat member with a 
crimson face agreed.&nbsp; It was true his wife was a very 
close-mouthed personage, which made a difference.&nbsp; If she 
had spoken out recklessly her lord might have been suspicious 
enough, as in the case of that lady who lived at Stapleford Park 
in their great-grandfathers&rsquo; time.&nbsp; Though there, to 
be sure, considerations arose which made her husband view matters
with much philosophy.</p>
<p>A few of the members doubted the possibility of this.</p>
<p>The crimson man, who was a retired maltster of comfortable 
means, <i>ventru</i>, and short in stature, cleared his throat, 
blew off his superfluous breath, and proceeded to give the 
instance before alluded to of such possibility, first apologizing
for his heroine&rsquo;s lack of a title, it never having been his
good fortune to know many of the nobility.&nbsp; To his style of 
narrative the following is only an approximation.</p>
<h2>DAME THE SIXTH&mdash;SQUIRE PETRICK&rsquo;S LADY<br />
By the Crimson Maltster</h2>
<p>Folk who are at all acquainted with the traditions of 
Stapleford Park will not need to be told that in the middle of 
the last century it was owned by that trump of mortgagees, 
Timothy Petrick, whose skill in gaining possession of fair 
estates by granting sums of money on their title-deeds has seldom
if ever been equalled in our part of England.&nbsp; Timothy was a
lawyer by profession, and agent to several noblemen, by which 
means his special line of business became opened to him by a sort
of revelation.&nbsp; It is said that a relative of his, a very 
deep thinker, who afterwards had the misfortune to be transported
for life for mistaken notions on the signing of a will, taught 
him considerable legal lore, which he creditably resolved never 
to throw away for the benefit of other people, but to reserve it 
entirely for his own.</p>
<p>However, I have nothing in particular to say about his early 
and active days, but rather of the time when, an old man, he had 
become the owner of vast estates by the means I have 
signified&mdash;among them the great manor of Stapleford, on 
which he lived, in the splendid old mansion now pulled down; 
likewise estates at Marlott, estates near Sherton Abbas, nearly 
all the borough of Millpool, and many properties near 
Ivell.&nbsp; Indeed, I can&rsquo;t call to mind half his landed 
possessions, and I don&rsquo;t know that it matters much at this 
time of day, seeing that he&rsquo;s been dead and gone many 
years.&nbsp; It is said that when he bought an estate he would 
not decide to pay the price till he had walked over every single 
acre with his own two feet, and prodded the soil at every point 
with his own spud, to test its quality, which, if we regard the 
extent of his properties, must have been a stiff business for 
him.</p>
<p>At the time I am speaking of he was a man over eighty, and his
son was dead; but he had two grandsons, the eldest of whom, his 
namesake, was married, and was shortly expecting issue.&nbsp; 
Just then the grandfather was taken ill, for death, as it seemed,
considering his age.&nbsp; By his will the old man had created an
entail (as I believe the lawyers call it), devising the whole of 
the estates to his elder grandson and his issue male, failing 
which, to his younger grandson and his issue male, failing which,
to remoter relatives, who need not be mentioned now.</p>
<p>While old Timothy Petrick was lying ill, his elder 
grandson&rsquo;s wife, Annetta, gave birth to her expected child,
who, as fortune would have it, was a son.&nbsp; Timothy, her 
husband, through sprung of a scheming family, was no great 
schemer himself; he was the single one of the Petricks then 
living whose heart had ever been greatly moved by sentiments 
which did not run in the groove of ambition; and on this account 
he had not married well, as the saying is; his wife having been 
the daughter of a family of no better beginnings than his own; 
that is to say, her father was a country townsman of the 
professional class.&nbsp; But she was a very pretty woman, by all
accounts, and her husband had seen, courted, and married her in a
high tide of infatuation, after a very short acquaintance, and 
with very little knowledge of her heart&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; He
had never found reason to regret his choice as yet, and his 
anxiety for her recovery was great.</p>
<p>She was supposed to be out of danger, and herself and the 
child progressing well, when there was a change for the worse, 
and she sank so rapidly that she was soon given over.&nbsp; When 
she felt that she was about to leave him, Annetta sent for her 
husband, and, on his speedy entry and assurance that they were 
alone, she made him solemnly vow to give the child every care in 
any circumstances that might arise, if it should please Heaven to
take her.&nbsp; This, of course, he readily promised.&nbsp; Then,
after some hesitation, she told him that she could not die with a
falsehood upon her soul, and dire deceit in her life; she must 
make a terrible confession to him before her lips were sealed for
ever.&nbsp; She thereupon related an incident concerning the 
baby&rsquo;s parentage, which was not as he supposed.</p>
<p>Timothy Petrick, though a quick-feeling man, was not of a sort
to show nerves outwardly; and he bore himself as heroically as he
possibly could do in this trying moment of his life.&nbsp; That 
same night his wife died; and while she lay dead, and before her 
funeral, he hastened to the bedside of his sick grandfather, and 
revealed to him all that had happened: the baby&rsquo;s birth, 
his wife&rsquo;s confession, and her death, beseeching the aged 
man, as he loved him, to bestir himself now, at the eleventh 
hour, and alter his will so as to dish the intruder.&nbsp; Old 
Timothy, seeing matters in the same light as his grandson, 
required no urging against allowing anything to stand in the way 
of legitimate inheritance; he executed another will, limiting the
entail to Timothy his grandson, for life, and his male heirs 
thereafter to be born; after them to his other grandson Edward, 
and Edward&rsquo;s heirs.&nbsp; Thus the newly-born infant, who 
had been the centre of so many hopes, was cut off and scorned as 
none of the elect.</p>
<p>The old mortgagee lived but a short time after this, the 
excitement of the discovery having told upon him considerably, 
and he was gathered to his fathers like the most charitable man 
in his neighbourhood.&nbsp; Both wife and grandparent being 
buried, Timothy settled down to his usual life as well as he was 
able, mentally satisfied that he had by prompt action defeated 
the consequences of such dire domestic treachery as had been 
shown towards him, and resolving to marry a second time as soon 
as he could satisfy himself in the choice of a wife.</p>
<p>But men do not always know themselves.&nbsp; The embittered 
state of Timothy Petrick&rsquo;s mind bred in him by degrees such
a hatred and mistrust of womankind that, though several specimens
of high attractiveness came under his eyes, he could not bring 
himself to the point of proposing marriage.&nbsp; He dreaded to 
take up the position of husband a second time, discerning a trap 
in every petticoat, and a Slough of Despond in possible 
heirs.&nbsp; &lsquo;What has happened once, when all seemed so 
fair, may happen again,&rsquo; he said to himself.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll risk my name no more.&rsquo;&nbsp; So he 
abstained from marriage, and overcame his wish for a lineal 
descendant to follow him in the ownership of Stapleford.</p>
<p>Timothy had scarcely noticed the unfortunate child that his 
wife had borne, after arranging for a meagre fulfilment of his 
promise to her to take care of the boy, by having him brought up 
in his house.&nbsp; Occasionally, remembering this promise, he 
went and glanced at the child, saw that he was doing well, gave a
few special directions, and again went his solitary way.&nbsp; 
Thus he and the child lived on in the Stapleford mansion-house 
till two or three years had passed by.&nbsp; One day he was 
walking in the garden, and by some accident left his snuff-box on
a bench.&nbsp; When he came back to find it he saw the little boy
standing there; he had escaped his nurse, and was making a 
plaything of the box, in spite of the convulsive sneezings which 
the game brought in its train.&nbsp; Then the man with the 
encrusted heart became interested in the little fellow&rsquo;s 
persistence in his play under such discomforts; he looked in the 
child&rsquo;s face, saw there his wife&rsquo;s countenance, 
though he did not see his own, and fell into thought on the 
piteousness of childhood&mdash;particularly of despised and 
rejected childhood, like this before him.</p>
<p>From that hour, try as he would to counteract the feeling, the
human necessity to love something or other got the better of what
he had called his wisdom, and shaped itself in a tender anxiety 
for the youngster Rupert.&nbsp; This name had been given him by 
his dying mother when, at her request, the child was baptized in 
her chamber, lest he should not survive for public baptism; and 
her husband had never thought of it as a name of any significance
till, about this time, he learnt by accident that it was the name
of the young Marquis of Christminster, son of the Duke of 
Southwesterland, for whom Annetta had cherished warm feelings 
before her marriage.&nbsp; Recollecting some wandering phrases in
his wife&rsquo;s last words, which he had not understood at the 
time, he perceived at last that this was the person to whom she 
had alluded when affording him a clue to little Rupert&rsquo;s 
history.</p>
<p>He would sit in silence for hours with the child, being no 
great speaker at the best of times; but the boy, on his part, was
too ready with his tongue for any break in discourse to arise 
because Timothy Petrick had nothing to say.&nbsp; After idling 
away his mornings in this manner, Petrick would go to his own 
room and swear in long loud whispers, and walk up and down, 
calling himself the most ridiculous dolt that ever lived, and 
declaring that he would never go near the little fellow again; to
which resolve he would adhere for the space perhaps of a 
day.&nbsp; Such cases are happily not new to human nature, but 
there never was a case in which a man more completely befocled 
his former self than in this.</p>
<p>As the child grew up, Timothy&rsquo;s attachment to him grew 
deeper, till Rupert became almost the sole object for which he 
lived.&nbsp; There had been enough of the family ambition latent 
in him for Timothy Petrick to feel a little envy when, some time 
before this date, his brother Edward had been accepted by the 
Honourable Harriet Mountclere, daughter of the second Viscount of
that name and title; but having discovered, as I have before 
stated, the paternity of his boy Rupert to lurk in even a higher 
stratum of society, those envious feelings speedily 
dispersed.&nbsp; Indeed, the more he reflected thereon, after his
brother&rsquo;s aristocratic marriage, the more content did he 
become.&nbsp; His late wife took softer outline in his memory, as
he thought of the lofty taste she had displayed, though only a 
plain burgher&rsquo;s daughter, and the justification for his 
weakness in loving the child&mdash;the justification that he had 
longed for&mdash;was afforded now in the knowledge that the boy 
was by nature, if not by name, a representative of one of the 
noblest houses in England.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was a woman of grand instincts, after all,&rsquo; 
he said to himself proudly.&nbsp; &lsquo;To fix her choice upon 
the immediate successor in that ducal line&mdash;it was finely 
conceived!&nbsp; Had he been of low blood like myself or my 
relations she would scarce have deserved the harsh measure that I
have dealt out to her and her offspring.&nbsp; How much less, 
then, when such grovelling tastes were farthest from her 
soul!&nbsp; The man Annetta loved was noble, and my boy is noble 
in spite of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The afterclap was inevitable, and it soon came.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;So far,&rsquo; he reasoned, &lsquo;from cutting off this 
child from inheritance of my estates, as I have done, I should 
have rejoiced in the possession of him!&nbsp; He is of pure stock
on one side at least, whilst in the ordinary run of affairs he 
would have been a commoner to the bone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Being a man, whatever his faults, of good old beliefs in the 
divinity of kings and those about &rsquo;em, the more he 
overhauled the case in this light, the more strongly did his poor
wife&rsquo;s conduct in improving the blood and breed of the 
Petrick family win his heart.&nbsp; He considered what ugly, 
idle, hard-drinking scamps many of his own relations had been; 
the miserable scriveners, usurers, and pawnbrokers that he had 
numbered among his forefathers, and the probability that some of 
their bad qualities would have come out in a merely corporeal 
child, to give him sorrow in his old age, turn his black hairs 
gray, his gray hairs white, cut down every stick of timber, and 
Heaven knows what all, had he not, like a skilful gardener, 
minded his grafting and changed the sort; till at length this 
right-minded man fell down on his knees every night and morning 
and thanked God that he was not as other meanly descended fathers
in such matters.</p>
<p>It was in the peculiar disposition of the Petrick family that 
the satisfaction which ultimately settled in Timothy&rsquo;s 
breast found nourishment.&nbsp; The Petricks had adored the 
nobility, and plucked them at the same time.&nbsp; That excellent
man Izaak Walton&rsquo;s feelings about fish were much akin to 
those of old Timothy Petrick, and of his descendants in a lesser 
degree, concerning the landed aristocracy.&nbsp; To torture and 
to love simultaneously is a proceeding strange to reason, but 
possible to practice, as these instances show.</p>
<p>Hence, when Timothy&rsquo;s brother Edward said slightingly 
one day that Timothy&rsquo;s son was well enough, but that he had
nothing but shops and offices in his backward perspective, while 
his own children, should he have any, would be far different, in 
possessing such a mother as the Honourable Harriet, Timothy felt 
a bound of triumph within him at the power he possessed of 
contradicting that statement if he chose.</p>
<p>So much was he interested in his boy in this new aspect that 
he now began to read up chronicles of the illustrious house 
ennobled as the Dukes of Southwesterland, from their very 
beginning in the glories of the Restoration of the blessed 
Charles till the year of his own time.&nbsp; He mentally noted 
their gifts from royalty, grants of lands, purchases, 
intermarriages, plantings and buildings; more particularly their 
political and military achievements, which had been great, and 
their performances in art and letters, which had been by no means
contemptible.&nbsp; He studied prints of the portraits of that 
family, and then, like a chemist watching a crystallization, 
began to examine young Rupert&rsquo;s face for the unfolding of 
those historic curves and shades that the painters Vandyke and 
Lely had perpetuated on canvas.</p>
<p>When the boy reached the most fascinating age of childhood, 
and his shouts of laughter ran through Stapleford House from end 
to end, the remorse that oppressed Timothy Petrick knew no 
bounds.&nbsp; Of all people in the world this Rupert was the one 
on whom he could have wished the estates to devolve; yet Rupert, 
by Timothy&rsquo;s own desperate strategy at the time of his 
birth, had been ousted from all inheritance of them; and, since 
he did not mean to remarry, the manors would pass to his brother 
and his brother&rsquo;s children, who would be nothing to him, 
whose boasted pedigree on one side would be nothing to his 
Rupert&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Had he only left the first will of his grandfather alone!</p>
<p>His mind ran on the wills continually, both of which were in 
existence, and the first, the cancelled one, in his own 
possession.&nbsp; Night after night, when the servants were all 
abed, and the click of safety locks sounded as loud as a crash, 
he looked at that first will, and wished it had been the second 
and not the first.</p>
<p>The crisis came at last.&nbsp; One night, after having enjoyed
the boy&rsquo;s company for hours, he could no longer bear that 
his beloved Rupert should be dispossessed, and he committed the 
felonious deed of altering the date of the earlier will to a 
fortnight later, which made its execution appear subsequent to 
the date of the second will already proved.&nbsp; He then boldly 
propounded the first will as the second.</p>
<p>His brother Edward submitted to what appeared to be not only 
incontestible fact, but a far more likely disposition of old 
Timothy&rsquo;s property; for, like many others, he had been much
surprised at the limitations defined in the other will, having no
clue to their cause.&nbsp; He joined his brother Timothy in 
setting aside the hitherto accepted document, and matters went on
in their usual course, there being no dispositions in the 
substituted will differing from those in the other, except such 
as related to a future which had not yet arrived.</p>
<p>The years moved on.&nbsp; Rupert had not yet revealed the 
anxiously expected historic lineaments which should foreshadow 
the political abilities of the ducal family aforesaid when it 
happened on a certain day that Timothy Petrick made the 
acquaintance of a well-known physician of Budmouth, who had been 
the medical adviser and friend of the late Mrs. Petrick&rsquo;s 
family for many years; though after Annetta&rsquo;s marriage, and
consequent removal to Stapleford, he had seen no more of her, the
neighbouring practitioner who attended the Petricks having then 
become her doctor as a matter of course.&nbsp; Timothy was 
impressed by the insight and knowledge disclosed in the 
conversation of the Budmouth physician, and the acquaintance 
ripening to intimacy, the physician alluded to a form of 
hallucination to which Annetta&rsquo;s mother and grandmother had
been subject&mdash;that of believing in certain dreams as 
realities.&nbsp; He delicately inquired if Timothy had ever 
noticed anything of the sort in his wife during her lifetime; he,
the physician, had fancied that he discerned germs of the same 
peculiarity in Annetta when he attended her in her 
girlhood.&nbsp; One explanation begat another, till the 
dumbfoundered Timothy Petrick was persuaded in his own mind that 
Annetta&rsquo;s confession to him had been based on a 
delusion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You look down in the mouth?&rsquo; said the doctor, 
pausing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A bit unmanned.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis 
unexpected-like,&rsquo; sighed Timothy.</p>
<p>But he could hardly believe it possible; and, thinking it best
to be frank with the doctor, told him the whole story which, till
now, he had never related to living man, save his dying 
grandfather.&nbsp; To his surprise, the physician informed him 
that such a form of delusion was precisely what he would have 
expected from Annetta&rsquo;s antecedents at such a physical 
crisis in her life.</p>
<p>Petrick prosecuted his inquiries elsewhere; and the upshot of 
his labours was, briefly, that a comparison of dates and places 
showed irrefutably that his poor wife&rsquo;s assertion could not
possibly have foundation in fact.&nbsp; The young Marquis of her 
tender passion&mdash;a highly moral and bright-minded 
nobleman&mdash;had gone abroad the year before Annetta&rsquo;s 
marriage, and had not returned till after her death.&nbsp; The 
young girl&rsquo;s love for him had been a delicate ideal 
dream&mdash;no more.</p>
<p>Timothy went home, and the boy ran out to meet him; whereupon 
a strangely dismal feeling of discontent took possession of his 
soul.&nbsp; After all, then, there was nothing but plebeian blood
in the veins of the heir to his name and estates; he was not to 
be succeeded by a noble-natured line.&nbsp; To be sure, Rupert 
was his son; but that glory and halo he believed him to have 
inherited from the ages, outshining that of his brother&rsquo;s 
children, had departed from Rupert&rsquo;s brow for ever; he 
could no longer read history in the boy&rsquo;s face, and 
centuries of domination in his eyes.</p>
<p>His manner towards his son grew colder and colder from that 
day forward; and it was with bitterness of heart that he 
discerned the characteristic features of the Petricks unfolding 
themselves by degrees.&nbsp; Instead of the elegant knife-edged 
nose, so typical of the Dukes of Southwesterland, there began to 
appear on his face the broad nostril and hollow bridge of his 
grandfather Timothy.&nbsp; No illustrious line of politicians was
promised a continuator in that graying blue eye, for it was 
acquiring the expression of the orb of a particularly 
objectionable cousin of his own; and, instead of the mouth-curves
which had thrilled Parliamentary audiences in speeches now bound 
in calf in every well-ordered library, there was the bull-lip of 
that very uncle of his who had had the misfortune with the 
signature of a gentleman&rsquo;s will, and had been transported 
for life in consequence.</p>
<p>To think how he himself, too, had sinned in this same matter 
of a will for this mere fleshly reproduction of a wretched old 
uncle whose very name he wished to forget!&nbsp; The boy&rsquo;s 
Christian name, even, was an imposture and an irony, for it 
implied hereditary force and brilliancy to which he plainly would
never attain.&nbsp; The consolation of real sonship was always 
left him certainly; but he could not help groaning to himself, 
&lsquo;Why cannot a son be one&rsquo;s own and somebody 
else&rsquo;s likewise!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis was shortly afterwards in the neighbourhood of 
Stapleford, and Timothy Petrick met him, and eyed his noble 
countenance admiringly.&nbsp; The next day, when Petrick was in 
his study, somebody knocked at the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rupert.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll Rupert thee, you young impostor!&nbsp; Say, 
only a poor commonplace Petrick!&rsquo; his father grunted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you have a voice like the Marquis&rsquo;s
I saw yesterday?&rsquo; he continued, as the lad came in.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you his looks, and a way of commanding, 
as if you&rsquo;d done it for centuries&mdash;hey?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&nbsp; How can you expect it, father, when 
I&rsquo;m not related to him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ugh!&nbsp; Then you ought to be!&rsquo; growled his 
father.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>As the narrator paused, the surgeon, the Colonel, the 
historian, the Spark, and others exclaimed that such subtle and 
instructive psychological studies as this (now that psychology 
was so much in demand) were precisely the tales they desired, as 
members of a scientific club, and begged the master-maltster to 
tell another curious mental delusion.</p>
<p>The maltster shook his head, and feared he was not genteel 
enough to tell another story with a sufficiently moral tone in it
to suit the club; he would prefer to leave the next to a better 
man.</p>
<p>The Colonel had fallen into reflection.&nbsp; True it was, he 
observed, that the more dreamy and impulsive nature of woman 
engendered within her erratic fancies, which often started her on
strange tracks, only to abandon them in sharp revulsion at the 
dictates of her common sense&mdash;sometimes with ludicrous 
effect.&nbsp; Events which had caused a lady&rsquo;s action to 
set in a particular direction might continue to enforce the same 
line of conduct, while she, like a mangle, would start on a 
sudden in a contrary course, and end where she began.</p>
<p>The Vice-President laughed, and applauded the Colonel, adding 
that there surely lurked a story somewhere behind that sentiment,
if he were not much mistaken.</p>
<p>The Colonel fixed his face to a good narrative pose, and went 
on without further preamble.</p>
<h2>DAME THE SEVENTH&mdash;ANNA, LADY BAXBY<br />
By the Colonel</h2>
<p>It was in the time of the great Civil War&mdash;if I should 
not rather, as a loyal subject, call it, with Clarendon, the 
Great Rebellion.&nbsp; It was, I say, at that unhappy period of 
our history, that towards the autumn of a particular year, the 
Parliament forces sat down before Sherton Castle with over seven 
thousand foot and four pieces of cannon.&nbsp; The Castle, as we 
all know, was in that century owned and occupied by one of the 
Earls of Severn, and garrisoned for his assistance by a certain 
noble Marquis who commanded the King&rsquo;s troops in these 
parts.&nbsp; The said Earl, as well as the young Lord Baxby, his 
eldest son, were away from home just now, raising forces for the 
King elsewhere.&nbsp; But there were present in the Castle, when 
the besiegers arrived before it, the son&rsquo;s fair wife Lady 
Baxby, and her servants, together with some friends and near 
relatives of her husband; and the defence was so good and 
well-considered that they anticipated no great danger.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary forces were also commanded by a noble 
lord&mdash;for the nobility were by no means, at this stage of 
the war, all on the King&rsquo;s side&mdash;and it had been 
observed during his approach in the night-time, and in the 
morning when the reconnoitring took place, that he appeared sad 
and much depressed.&nbsp; The truth was that, by a strange freak 
of destiny, it had come to pass that the stronghold he was set to
reduce was the home of his own sister, whom he had tenderly loved
during her maidenhood, and whom he loved now, in spite of the 
estrangement which had resulted from hostilities with her 
husband&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; He believed, too, that, 
notwithstanding this cruel division, she still was sincerely 
attached to him.</p>
<p>His hesitation to point his ordnance at the walls was 
inexplicable to those who were strangers to his family 
history.&nbsp; He remained in the field on the north side of the 
Castle (called by his name to this day because of his encampment 
there) till it occurred to him to send a messenger to his sister 
Anna with a letter, in which he earnestly requested her, as she 
valued her life, to steal out of the place by the little gate to 
the south, and make away in that direction to the residence of 
some friends.</p>
<p>Shortly after he saw, to his great surprise, coming from the 
front of the Castle walls a lady on horseback, with a single 
attendant.&nbsp; She rode straight forward into the field, and up
the slope to where his army and tents were spread.&nbsp; It was 
not till she got quite near that he discerned her to be his 
sister Anna; and much was he alarmed that she should have run 
such risk as to sally out in the face of his forces without 
knowledge of their proceedings, when at any moment their first 
discharge might have burst forth, to her own destruction in such 
exposure.&nbsp; She dismounted before she was quite close to him,
and he saw that her familiar face, though pale, was not at all 
tearful, as it would have been in their younger days.&nbsp; 
Indeed, if the particulars as handed down are to be believed, he 
was in a more tearful state than she, in his anxiety about 
her.&nbsp; He called her into his tent, out of the gaze of those 
around; for though many of the soldiers were honest and 
serious-minded men, he could not bear that she who had been his 
dear companion in childhood should be exposed to curious 
observation in this her great grief.</p>
<p>When they were alone in the tent he clasped her in his arms, 
for he had not seen her since those happier days when, at the 
commencement of the war, her husband and himself had been of the 
same mind about the arbitrary conduct of the King, and had little
dreamt that they would not go to extremes together.&nbsp; She was
the calmest of the two, it is said, and was the first to speak 
connectedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;William, I have come to you,&rsquo; said she, 
&lsquo;but not to save myself as you suppose.&nbsp; Why, oh, why 
do you persist in supporting this disloyal cause, and grieving us
so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say not that,&rsquo; he replied hastily.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;If truth hides at the bottom of a well, why should you 
suppose justice to be in high places?&nbsp; I am for the right at
any price.&nbsp; Anna, leave the Castle; you are my sister; come 
away, my dear, and save thy life!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never!&rsquo; says she.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you plan to 
carry out this attack, and level the Castle indeed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most certainly I do,&rsquo; says he.&nbsp; &lsquo;What 
meaneth this army around us if not so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you will find the bones of your sister buried in 
the ruins you cause!&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; And without another 
word she turned and left him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anna&mdash;abide with me!&rsquo; he entreated.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Blood is thicker than water, and what is there in common 
between you and your husband now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But she shook her head and would not hear him and hastening 
out, mounted her horse, and returned towards the Castle as she 
had come.&nbsp; Ay, many&rsquo;s the time when I have been riding
to hounds across that field that I have thought of that 
scene!</p>
<p>When she had quite gone down the field, and over the 
intervening ground, and round the bastion, so that he could no 
longer even see the tip of her mare&rsquo;s white tail, he was 
much more deeply moved by emotions concerning her and her welfare
than he had been while she was before him.&nbsp; He wildly 
reproached himself that he had not detained her by force for her 
own good, so that, come what might, she would be under his 
protection and not under that of her husband, whose impulsive 
nature rendered him too open to instantaneous impressions and 
sudden changes of plan; he was now acting in this cause and now 
in that, and lacked the cool judgment necessary for the 
protection of a woman in these troubled times.&nbsp; Her brother 
thought of her words again and again, and sighed, and even 
considered if a sister were not of more value than a principle, 
and if he would not have acted more naturally in throwing in his 
lot with hers.</p>
<p>The delay of the besiegers in attacking the Castle was said to
be entirely owing to this distraction on the part of their 
leader, who remained on the spot attempting some indecisive 
operations, and parleying with the Marquis, then in command, with
far inferior forces, within the Castle.&nbsp; It never occurred 
to him that in the meantime the young Lady Baxby, his sister, was
in much the same mood as himself.&nbsp; Her brother&rsquo;s 
familiar voice and eyes, much worn and fatigued by keeping the 
field, and by family distractions on account of this unhappy 
feud, rose upon her vision all the afternoon, and as day waned 
she grew more and more Parliamentarian in her principles, though 
the only arguments which had addressed themselves to her were 
those of family ties.</p>
<p>Her husband, General Lord Baxby, had been expected to return 
all the day from his excursion into the east of the county, a 
message having been sent to him informing him of what had 
happened at home; and in the evening he arrived with 
reinforcements in unexpected numbers.&nbsp; Her brother retreated
before these to a hill near Ivell, four or five miles off, to 
afford the men and himself some repose.&nbsp; Lord Baxby duly 
placed his forces, and there was no longer any immediate 
danger.&nbsp; By this time Lady Baxby&rsquo;s feelings were more 
Parliamentarian than ever, and in her fancy the fagged 
countenance of her brother, beaten back by her husband, seemed to
reproach her for heartlessness.&nbsp; When her husband entered 
her apartment, ruddy and boisterous, and full of hope, she 
received him but sadly; and upon his casually uttering some 
slighting words about her brother&rsquo;s withdrawal, which 
seemed to convey an imputation upon his courage, she resented 
them, and retorted that he, Lord Baxby himself, had been against 
the Court-party at first, where it would be much more to his 
credit if he were at present, and showing her brother&rsquo;s 
consistency of opinion, instead of supporting the lying policy of
the King (as she called it) for the sake of a barren principle of
loyalty, which was but an empty expression when a King was not at
one with his people.&nbsp; The dissension grew bitter between 
them, reaching to little less than a hot quarrel, both being 
quick-tempered souls.</p>
<p>Lord Baxby was weary with his long day&rsquo;s march and other
excitements, and soon retired to bed.&nbsp; His lady followed 
some time after.&nbsp; Her husband slept profoundly, but not so 
she; she sat brooding by the window-slit, and lifting the curtain
looked forth upon the hills without.</p>
<p>In the silence between the footfalls of the sentinels she 
could hear faint sounds of her brother&rsquo;s camp on the 
distant hills, where the soldiery had hardly settled as yet into 
their bivouac since their evening&rsquo;s retreat.&nbsp; The 
first frosts of autumn had touched the grass, and shrivelled the 
more delicate leaves of the creepers; and she thought of William 
sleeping on the chilly ground, under the strain of these 
hardships.&nbsp; Tears flooded her eyes as she returned to her 
husband&rsquo;s imputations upon his courage, as if there could 
be any doubt of Lord William&rsquo;s courage after what he had 
done in the past days.</p>
<p>Lord Baxby&rsquo;s long and reposeful breathings in his 
comfortable bed vexed her now, and she came to a determination on
an impulse.&nbsp; Hastily lighting a taper, she wrote on a scrap 
of paper:</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Blood is thicker than water</i>, <i>dear 
William&mdash;I will come</i>;&rsquo; and with this in her hand, 
she went to the door of the room, and out upon the stairs; on 
second thoughts turning back for a moment, to put on her 
husband&rsquo;s hat and cloak&mdash;not the one he was daily 
wearing&mdash;that if seen in the twilight she might at a casual 
glance appear as some lad or hanger-on of one of the household 
women; thus accoutred she descended a flight of circular stairs, 
at the bottom of which was a door opening upon the terrace 
towards the west, in the direction of her brother&rsquo;s 
position.&nbsp; Her object was to slip out without the sentry 
seeing her, get to the stables, arouse one of the varlets, and 
send him ahead of her along the highway with the note to warn her
brother of her approach, to throw in her lot with his.</p>
<p>She was still in the shadow of the wall on the west terrace, 
waiting for the sentinel to be quite out of the way, when her 
ears were greeted by a voice, saying, from the adjoining 
shade&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here I be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The tones were the tones of a woman.&nbsp; Lady Baxby made no 
reply, and stood close to the wall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My Lord Baxby,&rsquo; the voice continued; and she 
could recognize in it the local accent of some girl from the 
little town of Sherton, close at hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;I be tired of
waiting, my dear Lord Baxby!&nbsp; I was afeard you would never 
come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Baxby flushed hot to her toes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How the wench loves him!&rsquo; she said to herself, 
reasoning from the tones of the voice, which were plaintive and 
sweet and tender as a bird&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She changed from the 
home-hating truant to the strategic wife in one moment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hist!&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lord, you told me ten o&rsquo;clock, and &rsquo;tis 
near twelve now,&rsquo; continues the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;How 
could ye keep me waiting so if you love me as you said?&nbsp; I 
should have stuck to my lover in the Parliament troops if it had 
not been for thee, my dear lord!&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was not the least doubt that Lady Baxby had been 
mistaken for her husband by this intriguing damsel.&nbsp; Here 
was a pretty underhand business!&nbsp; Here were sly 
manoeuvrings!&nbsp; Here was faithlessness!&nbsp; Here was a 
precious assignation surprised in the midst!&nbsp; Her wicked 
husband, whom till this very moment she had ever deemed the soul 
of good faith&mdash;how could he!</p>
<p>Lady Baxby precipitately retreated to the door in the turret, 
closed it, locked it, and ascended one round of the staircase, 
where there was a loophole.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am not coming!&nbsp; 
I, Lord Baxby, despise ye and all your wanton tribe!&rsquo; she 
hissed through the opening; and then crept upstairs, as firmly 
rooted in Royalist principles as any man in the Castle.</p>
<p>Her husband still slept the sleep of the weary, well-fed, and 
well-drunken, if not of the just; and Lady Baxby quickly disrobed
herself without assistance&mdash;being, indeed, supposed by her 
woman to have retired to rest long ago.&nbsp; Before lying down, 
she noiselessly locked the door and placed the key under her 
pillow.&nbsp; More than that, she got a staylace, and, creeping 
up to her lord, in great stealth tied the lace in a tight knot to
one of his long locks of hair, attaching the other end of the 
lace to the bedpost; for, being tired herself now, she feared she
might sleep heavily; and, if her husband should wake, this would 
be a delicate hint that she had discovered all.</p>
<p>It is added that, to make assurance trebly sure, her gentle 
ladyship, when she had lain down to rest, held her lord&rsquo;s 
hand in her own during the whole of the night.&nbsp; But this is 
old-wives&rsquo; gossip, and not corroborated.&nbsp; What Lord 
Baxby thought and said when he awoke the next morning, and found 
himself so strangely tethered, is likewise only matter of 
conjecture; though there is no reason to suppose that his rage 
was great.&nbsp; The extent of his culpability as regards the 
intrigue was this much; that, while halting at a cross-road near 
Sherton that day, he had flirted with a pretty young woman, who 
seemed nothing loth, and had invited her to the Castle terrace 
after dark&mdash;an invitation which he quite forgot on his 
arrival home.</p>
<p>The subsequent relations of Lord and Lady Baxby were not again
greatly embittered by quarrels, so far as is known; though the 
husband&rsquo;s conduct in later life was occasionally eccentric,
and the vicissitudes of his public career culminated in long 
exile.&nbsp; The siege of the Castle was not regularly undertaken
till two or three years later than the time I have been 
describing, when Lady Baxby and all the women therein, except the
wife of the then Governor, had been removed to safe 
distance.&nbsp; That memorable siege of fifteen days by Fairfax, 
and the surrender of the old place on an August evening, is 
matter of history, and need not be told by me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The Man of Family spoke approvingly across to the Colonel when
the Club had done smiling, declaring that the story was an 
absolutely faithful page of history, as he had good reason to 
know, his own people having been engaged in that well-known 
scrimmage.&nbsp; He asked if the Colonel had ever heard the 
equally well-authenticated, though less martial tale of a certain
Lady Penelope, who lived in the same century, and not a score of 
miles from the same place?</p>
<p>The Colonel had not heard it, nor had anybody except the local
historian; and the inquirer was induced to proceed forthwith.</p>
<h2>DAME THE EIGHTH&mdash;THE LADY PENELOPE<br />
By the Man of Family</h2>
<p>In going out of Casterbridge by the low-lying road which 
eventually conducts to the town of Ivell, you see on the right 
hand an ivied manor-house, flanked by battlemented towers, and 
more than usually distinguished by the size of its many mullioned
windows.&nbsp; Though still of good capacity, the building is 
much reduced from its original grand proportions; it has, 
moreover, been shorn of the fair estate which once appertained to
its lord, with the exception of a few acres of park-land 
immediately around the mansion.&nbsp; This was formerly the seat 
of the ancient and knightly family of the Drenghards, or 
Drenkhards, now extinct in the male line, whose name, according 
to the local chronicles, was interpreted to mean <i>Strenuus 
Miles</i>, <i>vel Potator</i>, though certain members of the 
family were averse to the latter signification, and a duel was 
fought by one of them on that account, as is well known.&nbsp; 
With this, however, we are not now concerned.</p>
<p>In the early part of the reign of the first King James, there 
was visiting near this place of the Drenghards a lady of noble 
family and extraordinary beauty.&nbsp; She was of the purest 
descent; ah, there&rsquo;s seldom such blood nowadays as 
hers!&nbsp; She possessed no great wealth, it was said, but was 
sufficiently endowed.&nbsp; Her beauty was so perfect, and her 
manner so entrancing, that suitors seemed to spring out of the 
ground wherever she went, a sufficient cause of anxiety to the 
Countess her mother, her only living parent.&nbsp; Of these there
were three in particular, whom neither her mother&rsquo;s 
complaints of prematurity, nor the ready raillery of the maiden 
herself, could effectually put off.&nbsp; The said gallants were 
a certain Sir John Gale, a Sir William Hervy, and the well-known 
Sir George Drenghard, one of the Drenghard family 
before-mentioned.&nbsp; They had, curiously enough, all been 
equally honoured with the distinction of knighthood, and their 
schemes for seeing her were manifold, each fearing that one of 
the others would steal a march over himself.&nbsp; Not content 
with calling, on every imaginable excuse, at the house of the 
relative with whom she sojourned, they intercepted her in rides 
and in walks; and if any one of them chanced to surprise another 
in the act of paying her marked attentions, the encounter often 
ended in an altercation of great violence.&nbsp; So heated and 
impassioned, indeed, would they become, that the lady hardly felt
herself safe in their company at such times, notwithstanding that
she was a brave and buxom damsel, not easily put out, and with a 
daring spirit of humour in her composition, if not of 
coquetry.</p>
<p>At one of these altercations, which had place in her 
relative&rsquo;s grounds, and was unusually bitter, threatening 
to result in a duel, she found it necessary to assert 
herself.&nbsp; Turning haughtily upon the pair of disputants, she
declared that whichever should be the first to break the peace 
between them, no matter what the provocation, that man should 
never be admitted to her presence again; and thus would she 
effectually stultify the aggressor by making the promotion of a 
quarrel a distinct bar to its object.</p>
<p>While the two knights were wearing rather a crest-fallen 
appearance at her reprimand, the third, never far off, came upon 
the scene, and she repeated her caveat to him also.&nbsp; Seeing,
then, how great was the concern of all at her peremptory mood, 
the lady&rsquo;s manner softened, and she said with a roguish 
smile&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have patience, have patience, you foolish men!&nbsp; 
Only bide your time quietly, and, in faith, I will marry you all 
in turn!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They laughed heartily at this sally, all three together, as 
though they were the best of friends; at which she blushed, and 
showed some embarrassment, not having realized that her arch jest
would have sounded so strange when uttered.&nbsp; The meeting 
which resulted thus, however, had its good effect in checking the
bitterness of their rivalry; and they repeated her speech to 
their relatives and acquaintance with a hilarious frequency and 
publicity that the lady little divined, or she might have blushed
and felt more embarrassment still.</p>
<p>In the course of time the position resolved itself, and the 
beauteous Lady Penelope (as she was called) made up her mind; her
choice being the eldest of the three knights, Sir George 
Drenghard, owner of the mansion aforesaid, which thereupon became
her home; and her husband being a pleasant man, and his family, 
though not so noble, of as good repute as her own, all things 
seemed to show that she had reckoned wisely in honouring him with
her preference.</p>
<p>But what may lie behind the still and silent veil of the 
future none can foretell.&nbsp; In the course of a few months the
husband of her choice died of his convivialities (as if, indeed, 
to bear out his name), and the Lady Penelope was left alone as 
mistress of his house.&nbsp; By this time she had apparently 
quite forgotten her careless declaration to her lovers 
collectively; but the lovers themselves had not forgotten it; 
and, as she would now be free to take a second one of them, Sir 
John Gale appeared at her door as early in her widowhood as it 
was proper and seemly to do so.</p>
<p>She gave him little encouragement; for, of the two remaining, 
her best beloved was Sir William, of whom, if the truth must be 
told, she had often thought during her short married life.&nbsp; 
But he had not yet reappeared.&nbsp; Her heart began to be so 
much with him now that she contrived to convey to him, by 
indirect hints through his friends, that she would not be 
displeased by a renewal of his former attentions.&nbsp; Sir 
William, however, misapprehended her gentle signalling, and from 
excellent, though mistaken motives of delicacy, delayed to 
intrude himself upon her for a long time.&nbsp; Meanwhile Sir 
John, now created a baronet, was unremitting, and she began to 
grow somewhat piqued at the backwardness of him she secretly 
desired to be forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; her friends said jestingly to her 
(knowing of her humorous remark, as everybody did, that she would
marry them all three if they would have 
patience)&mdash;&lsquo;never mind; why hesitate upon the order of
them?&nbsp; Take &rsquo;em as they come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This vexed her still more, and regretting deeply, as she had 
often done, that such a careless speech should ever have passed 
her lips, she fairly broke down under Sir John&rsquo;s 
importunity, and accepted his hand.&nbsp; They were married on a 
fine spring morning, about the very time at which the unfortunate
Sir William discovered her preference for him, and was beginning 
to hasten home from a foreign court to declare his unaltered 
devotion to her.&nbsp; On his arrival in England he learnt the 
sad truth.</p>
<p>If Sir William suffered at her precipitancy under what she had
deemed his neglect, the Lady Penelope herself suffered 
more.&nbsp; She had not long been the wife of Sir John Gale 
before he showed a disposition to retaliate upon her for the 
trouble and delay she had put him to in winning her.&nbsp; With 
increasing frequency he would tell her that, as far as he could 
perceive, she was an article not worth such labour as he had 
bestowed in obtaining it, and such snubbings as he had taken from
his rivals on the same account.&nbsp; These and other cruel 
things he repeated till he made the lady weep sorely, and 
wellnigh broke her spirit, though she had formerly been such a 
mettlesome dame.&nbsp; By degrees it became perceptible to all 
her friends that her life was a very unhappy one; and the fate of
the fair woman seemed yet the harder in that it was her own 
stately mansion, left to her sole use by her first husband, which
her second had entered into and was enjoying, his being but a 
mean and meagre erection.</p>
<p>But such is the flippancy of friends that when she met them, 
and secretly confided her grief to their ears, they would say 
cheerily, &lsquo;Lord, never mind, my dear; there&rsquo;s a third
to come yet!&rsquo;&mdash;at which maladroit remark she would 
show much indignation, and tell them they should know better than
to trifle on so solemn a theme.&nbsp; Yet that the poor lady 
would have been only too happy to be the wife of the third, 
instead of Sir John whom she had taken, was painfully obvious, 
and much she was blamed for her foolish choice by some 
people.&nbsp; Sir William, however, had returned to foreign 
cities on learning the news of her marriage, and had never been 
heard of since.</p>
<p>Two or three years of suffering were passed by Lady Penelope 
as the despised and chidden wife of this man Sir John, amid 
regrets that she had so greatly mistaken him, and sighs for one 
whom she thought never to see again, till it chanced that her 
husband fell sick of some slight ailment.&nbsp; One day after 
this, when she was sitting in his room, looking from the window 
upon the expanse in front, she beheld, approaching the house on 
foot, a form she seemed to know well.&nbsp; Lady Penelope 
withdrew silently from the sickroom, and descended to the hall, 
whence, through the doorway, she saw entering between the two 
round towers, which at that time flanked the gateway, Sir William
Hervy, as she had surmised, but looking thin and 
travel-worn.&nbsp; She advanced into the courtyard to meet 
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was passing through Casterbridge,&rsquo; he said, 
with faltering deference, &lsquo;and I walked out to ask after 
your ladyship&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; I felt that I could do no 
less; and, of course, to pay my respects to your good husband, my
heretofore acquaintance . . . But oh, Penelope, th&rsquo;st look 
sick and sorry!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am heartsick, that&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>They could see in each other an emotion which neither wished 
to express, and they stood thus a long time with tears in their 
eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He does not treat &rsquo;ee well, I hear,&rsquo; said 
Sir William in a low voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;May God in Heaven 
forgive him; but it is asking a great deal!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, hush!&rsquo; said she hastily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, but I will speak what I may honestly say,&rsquo; 
he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am not under your roof, and my tongue
is free.&nbsp; Why didst not wait for me, Penelope, or send to me
a more overt letter?&nbsp; I would have travelled night and day 
to come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too late, William; you must not ask it,&rsquo; said 
she, endeavouring to quiet him as in old times.&nbsp; &lsquo;My 
husband just now is unwell.&nbsp; He will grow better in a day or
two, maybe.&nbsp; You must call again and see him before you 
leave Casterbridge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she said this their eyes met.&nbsp; Each was thinking of 
her lightsome words about taking the three men in turn; each 
thought that two-thirds of that promise had been fulfilled.&nbsp;
But, as if it were unpleasant to her that this recollection 
should have arisen, she spoke again quickly: &lsquo;Come again in
a day or two, when my husband will be well enough to see 
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir William departed without entering the house, and she 
returned to Sir John&rsquo;s chamber.&nbsp; He, rising from his 
pillow, said, &lsquo;To whom hast been talking, wife, in the 
courtyard?&nbsp; I heard voices there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated, and he repeated the question more 
impatiently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not wish to tell you now,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I wooll know!&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>Then she answered, &lsquo;Sir William Hervy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By G--- I thought as much!&rsquo; cried Sir John, drops
of perspiration standing on his white face.&nbsp; &lsquo;A 
skulking villain!&nbsp; A sick man&rsquo;s ears are keen, my 
lady.&nbsp; I heard that they were lover-like tones, and he 
called &rsquo;ee by your Christian name.&nbsp; These be your 
intrigues, my lady, when I am off my legs awhile!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On my honour,&rsquo; cried she, &lsquo;you do me a 
wrong.&nbsp; I swear I did not know of his coming!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Swear as you will,&rsquo; said Sir John, &lsquo;I 
don&rsquo;t believe &rsquo;ee.&rsquo;&nbsp; And with this he 
taunted her, and worked himself into a greater passion, which 
much increased his illness.&nbsp; His lady sat still, 
brooding.&nbsp; There was that upon her face which had seldom 
been there since her marriage; and she seemed to think anew of 
what she had so lightly said in the days of her freedom, when her
three lovers were one and all coveting her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
began at the wrong end of them,&rsquo; she murmured.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;My God&mdash;that did I!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A trifle,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I spoke to 
myself only.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was somewhat strange that after this day, while she went 
about the house with even a sadder face than usual, her churlish 
husband grew worse; and what was more, to the surprise of all, 
though to the regret of few, he died a fortnight later.&nbsp; Sir
William had not called upon him as he had promised, having 
received a private communication from Lady Penelope, frankly 
informing him that to do so would be inadvisable, by reason of 
her husband&rsquo;s temper.</p>
<p>Now when Sir John was gone, and his remains carried to his 
family burying-place in another part of England, the lady began 
in due time to wonder whither Sir William had betaken 
himself.&nbsp; But she had been cured of precipitancy (if ever 
woman were), and was prepared to wait her whole lifetime a widow 
if the said Sir William should not reappear.&nbsp; Her life was 
now passed mostly within the walls, or in promenading between the
pleasaunce and the bowling-green; and she very seldom went even 
so far as the high road which then skirted the grounds on the 
north, though it has now, and for many years, been diverted to 
the south side.&nbsp; Her patience was rewarded (if love be in 
any case a reward); for one day, many months after her second 
husband&rsquo;s death, a messenger arrived at her gate with the 
intelligence that Sir William Hervy was again in Casterbridge, 
and would be glad to know if it were her pleasure that he should 
wait upon her.</p>
<p>It need hardly be said that permission was joyfully granted, 
and within two hours her lover stood before her, a more 
thoughtful man than formerly, but in all essential respects the 
same man, generous, modest to diffidence, and sincere.&nbsp; The 
reserve which womanly decorum threw over her manner was but too 
obviously artificial, and when he said &lsquo;the ways of 
Providence are strange,&rsquo; and added after a moment, 
&lsquo;and merciful likewise,&rsquo; she could not conceal her 
agitation, and burst into tears upon his neck.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But this is too soon,&rsquo; she said, starting 
back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But no,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are eleven 
months gone in widowhood, and it is not as if Sir John had been a
good husband to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His visits grew pretty frequent now, as may well be guessed, 
and in a month or two he began to urge her to an early 
union.&nbsp; But she counselled a little longer delay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Surely I have waited 
long!&nbsp; Life is short; we are getting older every day, and I 
am the last of the three.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the lady frankly.&nbsp; &lsquo;And 
that is why I would not have you hasten.&nbsp; Our marriage may 
seem so strange to everybody, after my unlucky remark on that 
occasion we know so well, and which so many others know likewise,
thanks to talebearers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On this representation he conceded a little space, for the 
sake of her good name.&nbsp; But the destined day of their 
marriage at last arrived, and it was a gay time for the villagers
and all concerned, and the bells in the parish church rang from 
noon till night.&nbsp; Thus at last she was united to the man who
had loved her the most tenderly of them all, who but for his 
reticence might perhaps have been the first to win her.&nbsp; 
Often did he say to himself; &lsquo;How wondrous that her words 
should have been fulfilled!&nbsp; Many a truth hath been spoken 
in jest, but never a more remarkable one!&rsquo;&nbsp; The noble 
lady herself preferred not to dwell on the coincidence, a certain
shyness, if not shame, crossing her fair face at any allusion 
thereto.</p>
<p>But people will have their say, sensitive souls or none, and 
their sayings on this third occasion took a singular shape.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; they whispered, &lsquo;there is something 
more than chance in this . . . The death of the first was 
possibly natural; but what of the death of the second, who 
ill-used her, and whom, loving the third so desperately, she must
have wished out of the way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then they pieced together sundry trivial incidents of Sir 
John&rsquo;s illness, and dwelt upon the indubitable truth that 
he had grown worse after her lover&rsquo;s unexpected visit; till
a very sinister theory was built up as to the hand she may have 
had in Sir John&rsquo;s premature demise.&nbsp; But nothing of 
this suspicion was said openly, for she was a lady of noble 
birth&mdash;nobler, indeed, than either of her husbands&mdash;and
what people suspected they feared to express in formal 
accusation.</p>
<p>The mansion that she occupied had been left to her for so long
a time as she should choose to reside in it, and, having a regard
for the spot, she had coaxed Sir William to remain there.&nbsp; 
But in the end it was unfortunate; for one day, when in the full 
tide of his happiness, he was walking among the willows near the 
gardens, where he overheard a conversation between some 
basket-makers who were cutting the osiers for their use.&nbsp; In
this fatal dialogue the suspicions of the neighbouring townsfolk 
were revealed to him for the first time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A cupboard close to his bed, and the key in her 
pocket.&nbsp; Ah!&rsquo; said one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a blue phial therein&mdash;h&rsquo;m!&rsquo; said 
another.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And spurge-laurel leaves among the hearth-ashes.&nbsp; 
Oh-oh!&rsquo; said a third.</p>
<p>On his return home Sir William seemed to have aged 
years.&nbsp; But he said nothing; indeed, it was a thing 
impossible.&nbsp; And from that hour a ghastly estrangement 
began.&nbsp; She could not understand it, and simply 
waited.&nbsp; One day he said, however, &lsquo;I must go 
abroad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;William, have I 
offended you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;but I must go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She could coax little more out of him, and in itself there was
nothing unnatural in his departure, for he had been a wanderer 
from his youth.&nbsp; In a few days he started off, apparently 
quite another man than he who had rushed to her side so devotedly
a few months before.</p>
<p>It is not known when, or how, the rumours, which were so thick
in the atmosphere around her, actually reached the Lady 
Penelope&rsquo;s ears, but that they did reach her there is no 
doubt.&nbsp; It was impossible that they should not; the district
teemed with them; they rustled in the air like night-birds of 
evil omen.&nbsp; Then a reason for her husband&rsquo;s departure 
occurred to her appalled mind, and a loss of health became 
quickly apparent.&nbsp; She dwindled thin in the face, and the 
veins in her temples could all be distinctly traced.&nbsp; An 
inner fire seemed to be withering her away.&nbsp; Her rings fell 
off her fingers, and her arms hung like the flails of the 
threshers, though they had till lately been so round and so 
elastic.&nbsp; She wrote to her husband repeatedly, begging him 
to return to her; but he, being in extreme and wretched doubt, 
moreover, knowing nothing of her ill-health, and never suspecting
that the rumours had reached her also, deemed absence best, and 
postponed his return awhile, giving various good reasons for his 
delay.</p>
<p>At length, however, when the Lady Penelope had given birth to 
a still-born child, her mother, the Countess, addressed a letter 
to Sir William, requesting him to come back to her if he wished 
to see her alive; since she was wasting away of some mysterious 
disease, which seemed to be rather mental than physical.&nbsp; It
was evident that his mother-in-law knew nothing of the secret, 
for she lived at a distance; but Sir William promptly hastened 
home, and stood beside the bed of his now dying wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Believe me, William,&rsquo; she said when they were 
alone, &lsquo;I am innocent&mdash;innocent!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of what?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Heaven forbid 
that I should accuse you of anything!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you do accuse me&mdash;silently!&rsquo; she 
gasped.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could not write thereon&mdash;and ask you 
to hear me.&nbsp; It was too much, too degrading.&nbsp; But would
that I had been less proud!&nbsp; They suspect me of poisoning 
him, William!&nbsp; But, oh my dear husband, I am innocent of 
that wicked crime!&nbsp; He died naturally.&nbsp; I loved 
you&mdash;too soon; but that was all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nothing availed to save her.&nbsp; The worm had gnawed too far
into her heart before Sir William&rsquo;s return for anything to 
be remedial now; and in a few weeks she breathed her last.&nbsp; 
After her death the people spoke louder, and her conduct became a
subject of public discussion.&nbsp; A little later on, the 
physician, who had attended the late Sir John, heard the rumour, 
and came down from the place near London to which he latterly had
retired, with the express purpose of calling upon Sir William 
Hervy, now staying in Casterbridge.</p>
<p>He stated that, at the request of a relative of Sir 
John&rsquo;s, who wished to be assured on the matter by reason of
its suddenness, he had, with the assistance of a surgeon, made a 
private examination of Sir John&rsquo;s body immediately after 
his decease, and found that it had resulted from purely natural 
causes.&nbsp; Nobody at this time had breathed a suspicion of 
foul play, and therefore nothing was said which might afterwards 
have established her innocence.</p>
<p>It being thus placed beyond doubt that this beautiful and 
noble lady had been done to death by a vile scandal that was 
wholly unfounded, her husband was stung with a dreadful remorse 
at the share he had taken in her misfortunes, and left the 
country anew, this time never to return alive.&nbsp; He survived 
her but a few years, and his body was brought home and buried 
beside his wife&rsquo;s under the tomb which is still visible in 
the parish church.&nbsp; Until lately there was a good portrait 
of her, in weeds for her first husband, with a cross in her hand,
at the ancestral seat of her family, where she was much pitied, 
as she deserved to be.&nbsp; Yet there were some severe enough to
say&mdash;and these not unjust persons in other 
respects&mdash;that though unquestionably innocent of the crime 
imputed to her, she had shown an unseemly wantonness in 
contracting three marriages in such rapid succession; that the 
untrue suspicion might have been ordered by Providence (who often
works indirectly) as a punishment for her self-indulgence.&nbsp; 
Upon that point I have no opinion to offer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The reverend the Vice-President, however, the tale being 
ended, offered as his opinion that her fate ought to be quite 
clearly recognized as a punishment.&nbsp; So thought the 
Churchwarden, and also the quiet gentleman sitting near.&nbsp; 
The latter knew many other instances in point, one of which could
be narrated in a few words.</p>
<h2>DAME THE NINTH&mdash;THE DUCHESS OF HAMPTONSHIRE<br />
By the Quiet Gentleman</h2>
<p>Some fifty years ago, the then Duke of Hamptonshire, fifth of 
that title, was incontestibly the head man in his county, and 
particularly in the neighbourhood of Batton.&nbsp; He came of the
ancient and loyal family of Saxelbye, which, before its 
ennoblement, had numbered many knightly and ecclesiastical 
celebrities in its male line.&nbsp; It would have occupied a 
painstaking county historian a whole afternoon to take rubbings 
of the numerous effigies and heraldic devices graven to their 
memory on the brasses, tablets, and altar-tombs in the aisle of 
the parish-church.&nbsp; The Duke himself, however, was a man 
little attracted by ancient chronicles in stone and metal, even 
when they concerned his own beginnings.&nbsp; He allowed his mind
to linger by preference on the many graceless and unedifying 
pleasures which his position placed at his command.&nbsp; He 
could on occasion close the mouths of his dependents by a good 
bomb-like oath, and he argued doggedly with the parson on the 
virtues of cock-fighting and baiting the bull.</p>
<p>This nobleman&rsquo;s personal appearance was somewhat 
impressive.&nbsp; His complexion was that of the copper-beech 
tree.&nbsp; His frame was stalwart, though slightly 
stooping.&nbsp; His mouth was large, and he carried an unpolished
sapling as his walking-stick, except when he carried a spud for 
cutting up any thistle he encountered on his walks.&nbsp; His 
castle stood in the midst of a park, surrounded by dusky elms, 
except to the southward; and when the moon shone out, the 
gleaming stone facade, backed by heavy boughs, was visible from 
the distant high road as a white spot on the surface of 
darkness.&nbsp; Though called a castle, the building was little 
fortified, and had been erected with greater eye to internal 
convenience than those crannied places of defence to which the 
name strictly appertains.&nbsp; It was a castellated mansion as 
regular as a chessboard on its ground-plan, ornamented with 
make-believe bastions and machicolations, behind which were 
stacks of battlemented chimneys.&nbsp; On still mornings, at the 
fire-lighting hour, when ghostly house-maids stalk the corridors,
and thin streaks of light through the shutter-chinks lend 
startling winks and smiles to ancestors on canvas, twelve or 
fifteen thin stems of blue smoke sprouted upwards from these 
chimney-tops, and spread into a flat canopy on high.&nbsp; Around
the site stretched ten thousand acres of good, fat, unimpeachable
soil, plentiful in glades and lawns wherever visible from the 
castle-windows, and merging in homely arable where screened from 
the too curious eye by ingeniously-contrived plantations.</p>
<p>Some way behind the owner of all this came the second man in 
the parish, the rector, the Honourable and Reverend Mr. 
Oldbourne, a widower, over stiff and stern for a clergyman, whose
severe white neckcloth, well-kept gray hair, and right-lined face
betokened none of those sympathetic traits whereon depends so 
much of a parson&rsquo;s power to do good among his 
fellow-creatures.&nbsp; The last, far-removed man of the 
series&mdash;altogether the Neptune of these local 
primaries&mdash;was the curate, Mr. Alwyn Hill.&nbsp; He was a 
handsome young deacon with curly hair, dreamy eyes&mdash;so 
dreamy that to look long into them was like ascending and 
floating among summer clouds&mdash;a complexion as fresh as a 
flower, and a chin absolutely beardless.&nbsp; Though his age was
about twenty-five, he looked not much over nineteen.</p>
<p>The rector had a daughter called Emmeline, of so sweet and 
simple a nature that her beauty was discovered, measured, and 
inventoried by almost everybody in that part of the country 
before it was suspected by herself to exist.&nbsp; She had been 
bred in comparative solitude; a rencounter with men troubled and 
confused her.&nbsp; Whenever a strange visitor came to her 
father&rsquo;s house she slipped into the orchard and remained 
till he was gone, ridiculing her weakness in apostrophes, but 
unable to overcome it.&nbsp; Her virtues lay in no resistant 
force of character, but in a natural inappetency for evil things,
which to her were as unmeaning as joints of flesh to a 
herbivorous creature.&nbsp; Her charms of person, manner, and 
mind, had been clear for some time to the Antinous in orders, and
no less so to the Duke, who, though scandalously ignorant of 
dainty phrases, ever showing a clumsy manner towards the gentler 
sex, and, in short, not at all a lady&rsquo;s man, took fire to a
degree that was wellnigh terrible at sudden sight of Emmeline, a 
short time after she was turned seventeen.</p>
<p>It occurred one afternoon at the corner of a shrubbery between
the castle and the rectory, where the Duke was standing to watch 
the heaving of a mole, when the fair girl brushed past at a 
distance of a few yards, in the full light of the sun, and 
without hat or bonnet.&nbsp; The Duke went home like a man who 
had seen a spirit.&nbsp; He ascended to the picture-gallery of 
his castle, and there passed some time in staring at the bygone 
beauties of his line as if he had never before considered what an
important part those specimens of womankind had played in the 
evolution of the Saxelbye race.&nbsp; He dined alone, drank 
rather freely, and declared to himself that Emmeline Oldbourne 
must be his.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there had unfortunately arisen between the curate 
and this girl some sweet and secret understanding.&nbsp; 
Particulars of the attachment remained unknown then and always, 
but it was plainly not approved of by her father.&nbsp; His 
procedure was cold, hard, and inexorable.&nbsp; Soon the curate 
disappeared from the parish, almost suddenly, after bitter and 
hard words had been heard to pass between him and the rector one 
evening in the garden, intermingled with which, like the cries of
the dying in the din of battle, were the beseeching sobs of a 
woman.&nbsp; Not long after this it was announced that a marriage
between the Duke and Miss Oldbourne was to be solemnized at a 
surprisingly early date.</p>
<p>The wedding-day came and passed; and she was a Duchess.&nbsp; 
Nobody seemed to think of the ousted man during the day, or else 
those who thought of him concealed their meditations.&nbsp; Some 
of the less subservient ones were disposed to speak in a jocular 
manner of the august husband and wife, others to make correct and
pretty speeches about them, according as their sex and nature 
dictated.&nbsp; But in the evening, the ringers in the belfry, 
with whom Alwyn had been a favourite, eased their minds a little 
concerning the gentle young man, and the possible regrets of the 
woman he had loved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see something wrong in it all?&rsquo; 
said the third bell as he wiped his face.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know 
well enough where she would have liked to stable her horses 
to-night, when they have done their journey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is, you would know if you could tell where young 
Mr. Hill is living, which is known to none in the 
parish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Except to the lady that this ring o&rsquo; grandsire 
triples is in honour of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yet these friendly cottagers were at this time far from 
suspecting the real dimensions of Emmeline&rsquo;s misery, nor 
was it clear even to those who came into much closer communion 
with her than they, so well had she concealed her 
heart-sickness.&nbsp; But bride and bridegroom had not long been 
home at the castle when the young wife&rsquo;s unhappiness became
plainly enough perceptible.&nbsp; Her maids and men said that she
was in the habit of turning to the wainscot and shedding stupid 
scalding tears at a time when a right-minded lady would have been
overhauling her wardrobe.&nbsp; She prayed earnestly in the great
church-pew, where she sat lonely and insignificant as a mouse in 
a cell, instead of counting her rings, falling asleep, or amusing
herself in silent laughter at the queer old people in the 
congregation, as previous beauties of the family had done in 
their time.&nbsp; She seemed to care no more for eating and 
drinking out of crystal and silver than from a service of earthen
vessels.&nbsp; Her head was, in truth, full of something else; 
and that such was the case was only too obvious to the Duke, her 
husband.&nbsp; At first he would only taunt her for her folly in 
thinking of that milk-and-water parson; but as time went on his 
charges took a more positive shape.&nbsp; He would not believe 
her assurance that she had in no way communicated with her former
lover, nor he with her, since their parting in the presence of 
her father.&nbsp; This led to some strange scenes between them 
which need not be detailed; their result was soon to take a 
catastrophic shape.</p>
<p>One dark quiet evening, about two months after the marriage, a
man entered the gate admitting from the highway to the park and 
avenue which ran up to the house.&nbsp; He arrived within two 
hundred yards of the walls, when he left the gravelled drive and 
drew near to the castle by a roundabout path leading into a 
shrubbery.&nbsp; Here he stood still.&nbsp; In a few minutes the 
strokes of the castle-clock resounded, and then a female figure 
entered the same secluded nook from an opposite direction.&nbsp; 
There the two indistinct persons leapt together like a pair of 
dewdrops on a leaf; and then they stood apart, facing each other,
the woman looking down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emmeline, you begged me to come, and here I am, Heaven 
forgive me!&rsquo; said the man hoarsely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are going to emigrate, Alwyn,&rsquo; she said in 
broken accents.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have heard of it; you sail from 
Plymouth in three days in the <i>Western Glory</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I can live in England no longer.&nbsp; Life 
is as death to me here,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My life is even worse&mdash;worse than death.&nbsp; 
Death would not have driven me to this extremity.&nbsp; Listen, 
Alwyn&mdash;I have sent for you to beg to go with you, or at 
least to be near you&mdash;to do anything so that it be not to 
stay here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To go away with me?&rsquo; he said in a startled 
tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes&mdash;or under your direction, or by your help
in some way!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be horrified at me&mdash;you must 
bear with me whilst I implore it.&nbsp; Nothing short of cruelty 
would have driven me to this.&nbsp; I could have borne my doom in
silence had I been left unmolested; but he tortures me, and I 
shall soon be in the grave if I cannot escape.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To his shocked inquiry how her husband tortured her, the 
Duchess said that it was by jealousy.&nbsp; &lsquo;He tries to 
wring admissions from me concerning you,&rsquo; she said, 
&lsquo;and will not believe that I have not communicated with you
since my engagement to him was settled by my father, and I was 
forced to agree to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The poor curate said that this was the heaviest news of 
all.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has not personally ill-used you?&rsquo; he 
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What has he done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked fearfully around, and said, sobbing: &lsquo;In 
trying to make me confess to what I have never done, he adopts 
plans I dare not describe for terrifying me into a weak state, so
that I may own to anything!&nbsp; I resolved to write to you, as 
I had no other friend.&rsquo;&nbsp; She added, with dreary irony,
&lsquo;I thought I would give him some ground for his suspicion, 
so as not to disgrace his judgment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you really mean, Emmeline,&rsquo; he tremblingly 
inquired, &lsquo;that you&mdash;that you want to fly with 
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you think that I would act otherwise than in 
earnest at such a time as this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was silent for a minute or more.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must not 
go with me,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be sin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It <i>cannot</i> be sin, for I have never wanted to 
commit sin in my life; and it isn&rsquo;t likely I would begin 
now, when I pray every day to die and be sent to Heaven out of my
misery!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is wrong, Emmeline, all the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it wrong to run away from the fire that scorches 
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would look wrong, at any rate, in this 
case.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alwyn, Alwyn, take me, I beseech you!&rsquo; she burst 
out.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is not right in general, I know, but it is 
such an exceptional instance, this.&nbsp; Why has such a severe 
strain been put upon me?&nbsp; I was doing no harm, injuring no 
one, helping many people, and expecting happiness; yet trouble 
came.&nbsp; Can it be that God holds me in derision?&nbsp; I had 
no supporter&mdash;I gave way; and now my life is a burden and a 
shame to me . . . Oh, if you only knew how much to me this 
request to you is&mdash;how my life is wrapped up in it, you 
could not deny me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is almost beyond endurance&mdash;Heaven support 
us,&rsquo; he groaned.&nbsp; &lsquo;Emmy, you are the Duchess of 
Hamptonshire, the Duke of Hamptonshire&rsquo;s wife; you must not
go with me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And am I then refused?&mdash;Oh, am I refused?&rsquo; 
she cried frantically.&nbsp; &lsquo;Alwyn, Alwyn, do you say it 
indeed to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I do, dear, tender heart!&nbsp; I do most sadly 
say it.&nbsp; You must not go.&nbsp; Forgive me, for there is no 
alternative but refusal.&nbsp; Though I die, though you die, we 
must not fly together.&nbsp; It is forbidden in God&rsquo;s 
law.&nbsp; Good-bye, for always and ever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He tore himself away, hastened from the shrubbery, and 
vanished among the trees.</p>
<p>Three days after this meeting and farewell, Alwyn, his soft, 
handsome features stamped with a haggard hardness that ten years 
of ordinary wear and tear in the world could scarcely have 
produced, sailed from Plymouth on a drizzling morning, in the 
passenger-ship <i>Western Glory</i>.&nbsp; When the land had 
faded behind him he mechanically endeavoured to school himself 
into a stoical frame of mind.&nbsp; His attempt, backed up by the
strong moral staying power that had enabled him to resist the 
passionate temptation to which Emmeline, in her reckless 
trustfulness, had exposed him, was rewarded by a certain kind of 
success, though the murmuring stretch of waters whereon he gazed 
day after day too often seemed to be articulating to him in tones
of her well-remembered voice.</p>
<p>He framed on his journey rules of conduct for reducing to mild
proportions the feverish regrets which would occasionally arise 
and agitate him, when he indulged in visions of what might have 
been had he not hearkened to the whispers of conscience.&nbsp; He
fixed his thoughts for so many hours a day on philosophical 
passages in the volumes he had brought with him, allowing himself
now and then a few minutes&rsquo; thought of Emmeline, with the 
strict yet reluctant niggardliness of an ailing epicure 
proportioning the rank drinks that cause his malady.&nbsp; The 
voyage was marked by the usual incidents of a sailing-passage in 
those days&mdash;a storm, a calm, a man overboard, a birth, and a
funeral&mdash;the latter sad event being one in which he, as the 
only clergyman on board, officiated, reading the service ordained
for the purpose.&nbsp; The ship duly arrived at Boston early in 
the month following, and thence he proceeded to Providence to 
seek out a distant relative.</p>
<p>After a short stay at Providence he returned again to Boston, 
and by applying himself to a serious occupation made good 
progress in shaking off the dreary melancholy which enveloped him
even now.&nbsp; Distracted and weakened in his beliefs by his 
recent experiences, he decided that he could not for a time 
worthily fill the office of a minister of religion, and applied 
for the mastership of a school.&nbsp; Some introductions, given 
him before starting, were useful now, and he soon became known as
a respectable scholar and gentleman to the trustees of one of the
colleges.&nbsp; This ultimately led to his retirement from the 
school and installation in the college as Professor of rhetoric 
and oratory.</p>
<p>Here and thus he lived on, exerting himself solely because of 
a conscientious determination to do his duty.&nbsp; He passed his
winter evenings in turning sonnets and elegies, often giving his 
thoughts voice in &lsquo;Lines to an Unfortunate Lady,&rsquo; 
while his summer leisure at the same hour would be spent in 
watching the lengthening shadows from his window, and fancifully 
comparing them with the shades of his own life.&nbsp; If he 
walked, he mentally inquired which was the eastern quarter of the
landscape, and thought of two thousand miles of water that way, 
and of what was beyond it.&nbsp; In a word he was at all spare 
times dreaming of her who was only a memory to him, and would 
probably never be more.</p>
<p>Nine years passed by, and under their wear and tear Alwyn 
Hill&rsquo;s face lost a great many of the attractive 
characteristics which had formerly distinguished it.&nbsp; He was
kind to his pupils and affable to all who came in contact with 
him; but the kernel of his life, his secret, was kept as snugly 
shut up as though he had been dumb.&nbsp; In talking to his 
acquaintances of England and his life there, he omitted the 
episode of Batton Castle and Emmeline as if it had no existence 
in his calendar at all.&nbsp; Though of towering importance to 
himself, it had filled but a short and small fragment of time, an
ephemeral season which would have been wellnigh imperceptible, 
even to him, at this distance, but for the incident it 
enshrined.</p>
<p>One day, at this date, when cursorily glancing over an old 
English newspaper, he observed a paragraph which, short as it 
was, contained for him whole tomes of thrilling 
information&mdash;rung with more passion-stirring rhythm than the
collected cantos of all the poets.&nbsp; It was an announcement 
of the death of the Duke of Hamptonshire, leaving behind him a 
widow, but no children.</p>
<p>The current of Alwyn&rsquo;s thoughts now completely 
changed.&nbsp; On looking again at the newspaper he found it to 
be one that was sent him long ago, and had been carelessly thrown
aside.&nbsp; But for an accidental overhauling of the waste 
journals in his study he might not have known of the event for 
years.&nbsp; At this moment of reading the Duke had already been 
dead seven months.&nbsp; Alwyn could now no longer bind himself 
down to machine-made synecdoche, antithesis, and climax, being 
full of spontaneous specimens of all these rhetorical forms, 
which he dared not utter.&nbsp; Who shall wonder that his mind 
luxuriated in dreams of a sweet possibility now laid open for the
first time these many years? for Emmeline was to him now as ever 
the one dear thing in all the world.&nbsp; The issue of his 
silent romancing was that he resolved to return to her at the 
very earliest moment.</p>
<p>But he could not abandon his professional work on the 
instant.&nbsp; He did not get really quite free from engagements 
till four months later; but, though suffering throes of 
impatience continually, he said to himself every day: &lsquo;If 
she has continued to love me nine years she will love me ten; she
will think the more tenderly of me when her present hours of 
solitude shall have done their proper work; old times will revive
with the cessation of her recent experience, and every day will 
favour my return.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The enforced interval soon passed, and he duly arrived in 
England, reaching the village of Batton on a certain winter day 
between twelve and thirteen months subsequent to the time of the 
Duke&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>It was evening; yet such was Alwyn&rsquo;s impatience that he 
could not forbear taking, this very night, one look at the castle
which Emmeline had entered as unhappy mistress ten years 
before.&nbsp; He threaded the park trees, gazed in passing at 
well-known outlines which rose against the dim sky, and was soon 
interested in observing that lively country-people, in parties of
two and three, were walking before and behind him up the 
interlaced avenue to the castle gateway.&nbsp; Knowing himself to
be safe from recognition, Alwyn inquired of one of these 
pedestrians what was going on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her Grace gives her tenantry a ball to-night, to keep 
up the old custom of the Duke and his father before him, which 
she does not wish to change.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed.&nbsp; Has she lived here entirely alone since 
the Duke&rsquo;s death?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite alone.&nbsp; But though she doesn&rsquo;t receive
company herself, she likes the village people to enjoy 
themselves, and often has &rsquo;em here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kind-hearted, as always!&rsquo; thought Alwyn.</p>
<p>On reaching the castle he found that the great gates at the 
tradesmen&rsquo;s entrance were thrown back against the wall as 
if they were never to be closed again; that the passages and 
rooms in that wing were brilliantly lighted up, some of the 
numerous candles guttering down over the green leaves which 
decorated them, and upon the silk dresses of the happy 
farmers&rsquo; wives as they passed beneath, each on her 
husband&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; Alwyn found no difficulty in marching 
in along with the rest, the castle being Liberty Hall 
to-night.&nbsp; He stood unobserved in a corner of the large 
apartment where dancing was about to begin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her Grace, though hardly out of mourning, will be sure 
to come down and lead off the dance with neighbour Bates,&rsquo; 
said one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is neighbour Bates?&rsquo; asked Alwyn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An old man she respects much&mdash;the oldest of her 
tenant-farmers.&nbsp; He was seventy-eight his last 
birthday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, to be sure!&rsquo; said Alwyn, at his ease.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I remember.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The dancers formed in line, and waited.&nbsp; A door opened at
the farther end of the hall, and a lady in black silk came 
forth.&nbsp; She bowed, smiled, and proceeded to the top of the 
dance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is that lady?&rsquo; said Alwyn, in a puzzled 
tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought you told me that the Duchess of 
Hamptonshire&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is the Duchess,&rsquo; said his informant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there is another?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; there is no other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But she is not the Duchess of Hamptonshire&mdash;who 
used to&mdash;&rsquo; Alwyn&rsquo;s tongue stuck to his mouth, he
could get no farther.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; said his 
acquaintance.&nbsp; Alwyn had retired, and was supporting himself
against the wall.</p>
<p>The wretched Alwyn murmured something about a stitch in his 
side from walking.&nbsp; Then the music struck up, the dance went
on, and his neighbour became so interested in watching the 
movements of this strange Duchess through its mazes as to forget 
Alwyn for a while.</p>
<p>It gave him an opportunity to brace himself up.&nbsp; He was a
man who had suffered, and he could suffer again.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
came that person to be your Duchess?&rsquo; he asked in a firm, 
distinct voice, when he had attained complete self-command.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where is her other Grace of Hamptonshire?&nbsp; There 
certainly was another.&nbsp; I know it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, the previous one!&nbsp; Yes, yes.&nbsp; She ran 
away years and years ago with the young curate.&nbsp; Mr. Hill 
was the young man&rsquo;s name, if I recollect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&nbsp; She never did.&nbsp; What do you mean by 
that?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, she certainly ran away.&nbsp; She met the curate 
in the shrubbery about a couple of months after her marriage with
the Duke.&nbsp; There were folks who saw the meeting and heard 
some words of their talk.&nbsp; They arranged to go, and she 
sailed from Plymouth with him a day or two afterward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then &rsquo;tis the queerest lie ever told by 
man.&nbsp; Her father believed and knew to his dying day that she
went with him; and so did the Duke, and everybody about 
here.&nbsp; Ay, there was a fine upset about it at the 
time.&nbsp; The Duke traced her to Plymouth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Traced her to Plymouth?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He traced her to Plymouth, and set on his spies; and 
they found that she went to the shipping-office, and inquired if 
Mr. Alwyn Hill had entered his name as passenger by the 
<i>Western Glory</i>; and when she found that he had, she booked 
herself for the same ship, but not in her real name.&nbsp; When 
the vessel had sailed a letter reached the Duke from her, telling
him what she had done.&nbsp; She never came back here 
again.&nbsp; His Grace lived by himself a number of years, and 
married this lady only twelve months before he died.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alwyn was in a state of indescribable bewilderment.&nbsp; But,
unmanned as he was, he called the next day on the, to him, 
spurious Duchess of Hamptonshire.&nbsp; At first she was alarmed 
at his statement, then cold, then she was won over by his 
condition to give confidence for confidence.&nbsp; She showed him
a letter which had been found among the papers of the late Duke, 
corroborating what Alwyn&rsquo;s informant had detailed.&nbsp; It
was from Emmeline, bearing the postmarked date at which the 
<i>Western Glory</i> sailed, and briefly stated that she had 
emigrated by that ship to America.</p>
<p>Alwyn applied himself body and mind to unravel the remainder 
of the mystery.&nbsp; The story repeated to him was always the 
same: &lsquo;She ran away with the curate.&rsquo;&nbsp; A 
strangely circumstantial piece of intelligence was added to this 
when he had pushed his inquiries a little further.&nbsp; There 
was given him the name of a waterman at Plymouth, who had come 
forward at the time that she was missed and sought for by her 
husband, and had stated that he put her on board the <i>Western 
Glory</i> at dusk one evening before that vessel sailed.</p>
<p>After several days of search about the alleys and quays of 
Plymouth Barbican, during which these impossible words, 
&lsquo;She ran off with the curate,&rsquo; became branded on his 
brain, Alwyn found this important waterman.&nbsp; He was positive
as to the truth of his story, still remembering the incident 
well, and he described in detail the lady&rsquo;s dress, as he 
had long ago described it to her husband, which description 
corresponded in every particular with the dress worn by Emmeline 
on the evening of their parting.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to the other side of the Atlantic to 
continue his inquiries there, the puzzled and distracted Alwyn 
set himself to ascertain the address of Captain Wheeler, who had 
commanded the <i>Western Glory</i> in the year of Alwyn&rsquo;s 
voyage out, and immediately wrote a letter to him on the 
subject.</p>
<p>The only circumstances which the sailor could recollect or 
discover from his papers in connection with such a story were, 
that a woman bearing the name which Alwyn had mentioned as 
fictitious certainly did come aboard for a voyage he made about 
that time; that she took a common berth among the poorest 
emigrants; that she died on the voyage out, at about five 
days&rsquo; sail from Plymouth; that she seemed a lady in manners
and education.&nbsp; Why she had not applied for a first-class 
passage, why she had no trunks, they could not guess, for though 
she had little money in her pocket she had that about her which 
would have fetched it.&nbsp; &lsquo;We buried her at sea,&rsquo; 
continued the captain.&nbsp; &lsquo;A young parson, one of the 
cabin-passengers, read the burial-service over her, I remember 
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The whole scene and proceedings darted upon Alwyn&rsquo;s 
recollection in a moment.&nbsp; It was a fine breezy morning on 
that long-past voyage out, and he had been told that they were 
running at the rate of a hundred and odd miles a day.&nbsp; The 
news went round that one of the poor young women in the other 
part of the vessel was ill of fever, and delirious.&nbsp; The 
tidings caused no little alarm among all the passengers, for the 
sanitary conditions of the ship were anything but 
satisfactory.&nbsp; Shortly after this the doctor announced that 
she had died.&nbsp; Then Alwyn had learnt that she was laid out 
for burial in great haste, because of the danger that would have 
been incurred by delay.&nbsp; And next the funeral scene rose 
before him, and the prominent part that he had taken in that 
solemn ceremony.&nbsp; The captain had come to him, requesting 
him to officiate, as there was no chaplain on board.&nbsp; This 
he had agreed to do; and as the sun went down with a blaze in his
face he read amidst them all assembled: &lsquo;We therefore 
commit her body to the deep, to be turned into corruption, 
looking for the resurrection of the body when the sea shall give 
up her dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The captain also forwarded the addresses of the ship&rsquo;s 
matron and of other persons who had been engaged on board at the 
date.&nbsp; To these Alwyn went in the course of time.&nbsp; A 
categorical description of the clothes of the dead truant, the 
colour of her hair, and other things, extinguished for ever all 
hope of a mistake in identity.</p>
<p>At last, then, the course of events had become clear.&nbsp; On
that unhappy evening when he left Emmeline in the shrubbery, 
forbidding her to follow him because it would be a sin, she must 
have disobeyed.&nbsp; She must have followed at his heels 
silently through the darkness, like a poor pet animal that will 
not be driven back.&nbsp; She could have accumulated nothing for 
the journey more than she might have carried in her hand; and 
thus poorly provided she must have embarked.&nbsp; Her intention 
had doubtless been to make her presence on board known to him as 
soon as she could muster courage to do so.</p>
<p>Thus the ten years&rsquo; chapter of Alwyn Hill&rsquo;s 
romance wound itself up under his eyes.&nbsp; That the poor young
woman in the steerage had been the young Duchess of Hamptonshire 
was never publicly disclosed.&nbsp; Hill had no longer any reason
for remaining in England, and soon after left its shores with no 
intention to return.&nbsp; Previous to his departure he confided 
his story to an old friend from his native town&mdash;grandfather
of the person who now relates it to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>A few members, including the Bookworm, seemed to be impressed 
by the quiet gentleman&rsquo;s tale; but the member we have 
called the Spark&mdash;who, by the way, was getting somewhat 
tinged with the light of other days, and owned to 
eight-and-thirty&mdash;walked daintily about the room instead of 
sitting down by the fire with the majority and said that for his 
part he preferred something more lively than the last 
story&mdash;something in which such long-separated lovers were 
ultimately united.&nbsp; He also liked stories that were more 
modern in their date of action than those he had heard 
to-day.</p>
<p>Members immediately requested him to give them a specimen, to 
which the Spark replied that he didn&rsquo;t mind, as far as that
went.&nbsp; And though the Vice-President, the Man of Family, the
Colonel, and others, looked at their watches, and said they must 
soon retire to their respective quarters in the hotel adjoining, 
they all decided to sit out the Spark&rsquo;s story.</p>
<h2>DAME THE TENTH&mdash;THE HONOURABLE LAURA<br />
By the Spark</h2>
<p>It was a cold and gloomy Christmas Eve.&nbsp; The mass of 
cloud overhead was almost impervious to such daylight as still 
lingered on; the snow lay several inches deep upon the ground, 
and the slanting downfall which still went on threatened to 
considerably increase its thickness before the morning.&nbsp; The
Prospect Hotel, a building standing near the wild north coast of 
Lower Wessex, looked so lonely and so useless at such a time as 
this that a passing wayfarer would have been led to forget summer
possibilities, and to wonder at the commercial courage which 
could invest capital, on the basis of the popular taste for the 
picturesque, in a country subject to such dreary phases.&nbsp; 
That the district was alive with visitors in August seemed but a 
dim tradition in weather so totally opposed to all that tempts 
mankind from home.&nbsp; However, there the hotel stood 
immovable; and the cliffs, creeks, and headlands which were the 
primary attractions of the spot, rising in full view on the 
opposite side of the valley, were now but stern angular outlines,
while the townlet in front was tinged over with a grimy dirtiness
rather than the pearly gray that in summer lent such beauty to 
its appearance.</p>
<p>Within the hotel commanding this outlook the landlord walked 
idly about with his hands in his pockets, not in the least 
expectant of a visitor, and yet unable to settle down to any 
occupation which should compensate in some degree for the losses 
that winter idleness entailed on his regular profession.&nbsp; So
little, indeed, was anybody expected, that the coffee-room 
waiter&mdash;a genteel boy, whose plated buttons in summer were 
as close together upon the front of his short jacket as peas in a
pod&mdash;now appeared in the back yard, metamorphosed into the 
unrecognizable shape of a rough country lad in corduroys and 
hobnailed boots, sweeping the snow away, and talking the local 
dialect in all its purity, quite oblivious of the new polite 
accent he had learned in the hot weather from the well-behaved 
visitors.&nbsp; The front door was closed, and, as if to express 
still more fully the sealed and chrysalis state of the 
establishment, a sand-bag was placed at the bottom to keep out 
the insidious snowdrift, the wind setting in directly from that 
quarter.</p>
<p>The landlord, entering his own parlour, walked to the large 
fire which it was absolutely necessary to keep up for his 
comfort, no such blaze burning in the coffee-room or elsewhere, 
and after giving it a stir returned to a table in the lobby, 
whereon lay the visitors&rsquo; book&mdash;now closed and pushed 
back against the wall.&nbsp; He carelessly opened it; not a name 
had been entered there since the 19th of the previous November, 
and that was only the name of a man who had arrived on a 
tricycle, who, indeed, had not been asked to enter at all.</p>
<p>While he was engaged thus the evening grew darker; but before 
it was as yet too dark to distinguish objects upon the road 
winding round the back of the cliffs, the landlord perceived a 
black spot on the distant white, which speedily enlarged itself 
and drew near.&nbsp; The probabilities were that this 
vehicle&mdash;for a vehicle of some sort it seemed to 
be&mdash;would pass by and pursue its way to the nearest 
railway-town as others had done.&nbsp; But, contrary to the 
landlord&rsquo;s expectation, as he stood conning it through the 
yet unshuttered windows, the solitary object, on reaching the 
corner, turned into the hotel-front, and drove up to the 
door.</p>
<p>It was a conveyance particularly unsuited to such a season and
weather, being nothing more substantial than an open 
basket-carriage drawn by a single horse.&nbsp; Within sat two 
persons, of different sexes, as could soon be discerned, in spite
of their muffled attire.&nbsp; The man held the reins, and the 
lady had got some shelter from the storm by clinging close to his
side.&nbsp; The landlord rang the hostler&rsquo;s bell to attract
the attention of the stable-man, for the approach of the visitors
had been deadened to noiselessness by the snow, and when the 
hostler had come to the horse&rsquo;s head the gentleman and lady
alighted, the landlord meeting them in the hall.</p>
<p>The male stranger was a foreign-looking individual of about 
eight-and-twenty.&nbsp; He was close-shaven, excepting a 
moustache, his features being good, and even handsome.&nbsp; The 
lady, who stood timidly behind him, seemed to be much 
younger&mdash;possibly not more than eighteen, though it was 
difficult to judge either of her age or appearance in her present
wrappings.</p>
<p>The gentleman expressed his wish to stay till the morning, 
explaining somewhat unnecessarily, considering that the house was
an inn, that they had been unexpectedly benighted on their 
drive.&nbsp; Such a welcome being given them as landlords can 
give in dull times, the latter ordered fires in the drawing and 
coffee-rooms, and went to the boy in the yard, who soon scrubbed 
himself up, dragged his disused jacket from its box, polished the
buttons with his sleeve, and appeared civilized in the 
hall.&nbsp; The lady was shown into a room where she could take 
off her snow-damped garments, which she sent down to be dried, 
her companion, meanwhile, putting a couple of sovereigns on the 
table, as if anxious to make everything smooth and comfortable at
starting, and requesting that a private sitting-room might be got
ready.&nbsp; The landlord assured him that the best upstairs 
parlour&mdash;usually public&mdash;should be kept private this 
evening, and sent the maid to light the candles.&nbsp; Dinner was
prepared for them, and, at the gentleman&rsquo;s desire, served 
in the same apartment; where, the young lady having joined him, 
they were left to the rest and refreshment they seemed to 
need.</p>
<p>That something was peculiar in the relations of the pair had 
more than once struck the landlord, though wherein that 
peculiarity lay it was hard to decide.&nbsp; But that his guest 
was one who paid his way readily had been proved by his conduct, 
and dismissing conjectures, he turned to practical affairs.</p>
<p>About nine o&rsquo;clock he re-entered the hall, and, 
everything being done for the day, again walked up and down, 
occasionally gazing through the glass door at the prospect 
without, to ascertain how the weather was progressing.&nbsp; 
Contrary to prognostication, snow had ceased falling, and, with 
the rising of the moon, the sky had partially cleared, light 
fleeces of cloud drifting across the silvery disk.&nbsp; There 
was every sign that a frost was going to set in later on.&nbsp; 
For these reasons the distant rising road was even more distinct 
now between its high banks than it had been in the declining 
daylight.&nbsp; Not a track or rut broke the virgin surface of 
the white mantle that lay along it, all marks left by the lately 
arrived travellers having been speedily obliterated by the flakes
falling at the time.</p>
<p>And now the landlord beheld by the light of the moon a sight 
very similar to that he had seen by the light of day.&nbsp; Again
a black spot was advancing down the road that margined the 
coast.&nbsp; He was in a moment or two enabled to perceive that 
the present vehicle moved onward at a more headlong pace than the
little carriage which had preceded it; next, that it was a 
brougham drawn by two powerful horses; next, that this carriage, 
like the former one, was bound for the hotel-door.&nbsp; This 
desirable feature of resemblance caused the landlord to once more
withdraw the sand-bag and advance into the porch.</p>
<p>An old gentleman was the first to alight.&nbsp; He was 
followed by a young one, and both unhesitatingly came 
forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has a young lady, less than nineteen years of age, 
recently arrived here in the company of a man some years her 
senior?&rsquo; asked the old gentleman, in haste.&nbsp; &lsquo;A 
man cleanly shaven for the most part, having the appearance of an
opera-singer, and calling himself Signor Smithozzi?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have had arrivals lately,&rsquo; said the landlord, 
in the tone of having had twenty at least&mdash;not caring to 
acknowledge the attenuated state of business that afflicted 
Prospect Hotel in winter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And among them can your memory recall two persons such 
as those I describe?&mdash;the man a sort of baritone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There certainly is or was a young couple staying in the
hotel; but I could not pronounce on the compass of the 
gentleman&rsquo;s voice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; of course not.&nbsp; I am quite 
bewildered.&nbsp; They arrived in a basket-carriage, altogether 
badly provided?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They came in a carriage, I believe, as most of our 
visitors do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes.&nbsp; I must see them at once.&nbsp; Pardon 
my want of ceremony, and show us in to where they are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, sir, you forget.&nbsp; Suppose the lady and 
gentleman I mean are not the lady and gentleman you mean?&nbsp; 
It would be awkward to allow you to rush in upon them just now 
while they are at dinner, and might cause me to lose their future
patronage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True, true.&nbsp; They may not be the same 
persons.&nbsp; My anxiety, I perceive, makes me rash in my 
assumptions!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon the whole, I think they must be the same, Uncle 
Quantock,&rsquo; said the young man, who had not till now 
spoken.&nbsp; And turning to the landlord: &lsquo;You possibly 
have not such a large assemblage of visitors here, on this 
somewhat forbidding evening, that you quite forget how this 
couple arrived, and what the lady wore?&rsquo;&nbsp; His tone of 
addressing the landlord had in it a quiet frigidity that was not 
without irony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! what she wore; that&rsquo;s it, James.&nbsp; What 
did she wear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t usually take stock of my guests&rsquo; 
clothing,&rsquo; replied the landlord drily, for the ready money 
of the first arrival had decidedly biassed him in favour of that 
gentleman&rsquo;s cause.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can certainly see some 
of it if you want to,&rsquo; he added carelessly, &lsquo;for it 
is drying by the kitchen fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before the words were half out of his mouth the old gentleman 
had exclaimed, &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; and precipitated himself along 
what seemed to be the passage to the kitchen; but as this turned 
out to be only the entrance to a dark china-closet, he hastily 
emerged again, after a collision with the inn-crockery had told 
him of his mistake.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, I&rsquo;m sure; but if you only knew
my feelings (which I cannot at present explain), you would make 
allowances.&nbsp; Anything I have broken I will willingly pay 
for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, sir,&rsquo; said the 
landlord.&nbsp; And showing the way, they adjourned to the 
kitchen without further parley.&nbsp; The eldest of the party 
instantly seized the lady&rsquo;s cloak, that hung upon a 
clothes-horse, exclaiming: &lsquo;Ah! yes, James, it is 
hers.&nbsp; I knew we were on their track.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it is hers,&rsquo; answered the nephew quietly, 
for he was much less excited than his companion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Show us their room at once,&rsquo; said the old 
man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;William, have the lady and gentleman in the front 
sitting-room finished dining?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, long ago,&rsquo; said the hundred plated 
buttons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then show up these gentlemen to them at once.&nbsp; You
stay here to-night, gentlemen, I presume?&nbsp; Shall the horses 
be taken out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Feed the horses and wash their mouths.&nbsp; Whether we
stay or not depends upon circumstances,&rsquo; said the placid 
younger man, as he followed his uncle and the waiter to the 
staircase.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think, Nephew James,&rsquo; said the former, as he 
paused with his foot on the first step&mdash;&lsquo;I think we 
had better not be announced, but take them by surprise.&nbsp; She
may go throwing herself out of the window, or do some equally 
desperate thing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, certainly, we&rsquo;ll enter 
unannounced.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he called back the lad who preceded
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot sufficiently thank you, James, for so 
effectually aiding me in this pursuit!&rsquo; exclaimed the old 
gentleman, taking the other by the hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;My 
increasing infirmities would have hindered my overtaking her 
to-night, had it not been for your timely aid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am only too happy, uncle, to have been of service to 
you in this or any other matter.&nbsp; I only wish I could have 
accompanied you on a pleasanter journey.&nbsp; However, it is 
advisable to go up to them at once, or they may hear 
us.&rsquo;&nbsp; And they softly ascended the stairs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>On the door being opened, a room too large to be comfortable, 
lit by the best branch-candlesticks of the hotel, was disclosed, 
before the fire of which apartment the truant couple were 
sitting, very innocently looking over the hotel scrap-book and 
the album containing views of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; No sooner 
had the old man entered than the young lady&mdash;who now showed 
herself to be quite as young as described, and remarkably 
prepossessing as to features&mdash;perceptibly turned pale.&nbsp;
When the nephew entered, she turned still paler, as if she were 
going to faint.&nbsp; The young man described as an opera-singer 
rose with grim civility, and placed chairs for his visitors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Caught you, thank God!&rsquo; said the old gentleman 
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, worse luck, my lord!&rsquo; murmured Signor 
Smithozzi, in native London-English, that distinguished alien 
having, in fact, first seen the light in the vicinity of the City
Road.&nbsp; &lsquo;She would have been mine to-morrow.&nbsp; And 
I think that under the peculiar circumstances it would be 
wiser&mdash;considering how soon the breath of scandal will 
tarnish a lady&rsquo;s fame&mdash;to let her be mine to-morrow, 
just the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never!&rsquo; said the old man.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here is a 
lady under age, without experience&mdash;child-like in her maiden
innocence and virtue&mdash;whom you have plied by your vile arts,
till this morning at dawn&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord Quantock, were I not bound to respect your gray 
hairs&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Till this morning at dawn you tempted her away from her
father&rsquo;s roof.&nbsp; What blame can attach to her conduct 
that will not, on a full explanation of the matter, be readily 
passed over in her and thrown entirely on you?&nbsp; Laura, you 
return at once with me.&nbsp; I should not have arrived, after 
all, early enough to deliver you, if it had not been for the 
disinterestedness of your cousin, Captain Northbrook, who, on my 
discovering your flight this morning, offered with a promptitude 
for which I can never sufficiently thank him, to accompany me on 
my journey, as the only male relative I have near me.&nbsp; Come,
do you hear?&nbsp; Put on your things; we are off at 
once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go!&rsquo; pouted the young 
lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I daresay you don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied her father 
drily.&nbsp; &lsquo;But children never know what&rsquo;s best for
them.&nbsp; So come along, and trust to my opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Laura was silent, and did not move, the opera gentleman 
looking helplessly into the fire, and the lady&rsquo;s cousin 
sitting meditatively calm, as the single one of the four whose 
position enabled him to survey the whole escapade with the cool 
criticism of a comparative outsider.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say to you, Laura, as the father of a daughter under 
age, that you instantly come with me.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Would you
compel me to use physical force to reclaim you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to return!&rsquo; again declared 
Laura.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is your duty to return nevertheless, and at once, I 
inform you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, dear Laura, this is what I say: return with me and
your cousin James quietly, like a good and repentant girl, and 
nothing will be said.&nbsp; Nobody knows what has happened as 
yet, and if we start at once, we shall be home before it is light
to-morrow morning.&nbsp; Come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not obliged to come at your bidding, father, and I
would rather not!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now James, the cousin, during this dialogue might have been 
observed to grow somewhat restless, and even impatient.&nbsp; 
More than once he had parted his lips to speak, but second 
thoughts each time held him back.&nbsp; The moment had come, 
however, when he could keep silence no longer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, madam!&rsquo; he spoke out, &lsquo;this farce 
with your father has, in my opinion, gone on long enough.&nbsp; 
Just make no more ado, and step downstairs with us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She gave herself an intractable little twist, and did not 
reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the Lord Harry, Laura, I won&rsquo;t stand 
this!&rsquo; he said angrily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, get on your 
things before I come and compel you.&nbsp; There is a kind of 
compulsion to which this talk is child&rsquo;s play.&nbsp; Come, 
madam&mdash;instantly, I say!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old nobleman turned to his nephew and said mildly: 
&lsquo;Leave me to insist, James.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t become 
you.&nbsp; I can speak to her sharply enough, if I 
choose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James, however, did not heed his uncle, and went on to the 
troublesome young woman: &lsquo;You say you don&rsquo;t want to 
come, indeed!&nbsp; A pretty story to tell me, that!&nbsp; Come, 
march out of the room at once, and leave that hulking fellow for 
me to deal with afterward.&nbsp; Get on 
quickly&mdash;come!&rsquo; and he advanced toward her as if to 
pull her by the hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, nay,&rsquo; expostulated Laura&rsquo;s father, 
much surprised at his nephew&rsquo;s sudden demeanour.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You take too much upon yourself.&nbsp; Leave her to 
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t leave her to you any longer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have no right, James, to address either me or her 
in this way; so just hold your tongue.&nbsp; Come, my 
dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have every right!&rsquo; insisted James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you make that out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have the right of a husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whose husband?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s my wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;James!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, to cut a long story short, I may say that she 
secretly married me, in spite of your lordship&rsquo;s 
prohibition, about three months ago.&nbsp; And I must add that, 
though she cooled down rather quickly, everything went on 
smoothly enough between us for some time; in spite of the 
awkwardness of meeting only by stealth.&nbsp; We were only 
waiting for a convenient moment to break the news to you when 
this idle Adonis turned up, and after poisoning her mind against 
me, brought her into this disgrace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here the operatic luminary, who had sat in rather an 
abstracted and nerveless attitude till the cousin made his 
declaration, fired up and cried: &lsquo;I declare before Heaven 
that till this moment I never knew she was a wife!&nbsp; I found 
her in her father&rsquo;s house an unhappy girl&mdash;unhappy, as
I believe, because of the loneliness and dreariness of that 
establishment, and the want of society, and for nothing else 
whatever.&nbsp; What this statement about her being your wife 
means I am quite at a loss to understand.&nbsp; Are you indeed 
married to him, Laura?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Laura nodded from within her tearful handkerchief.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;It was because of my anomalous position in being privately
married to him,&rsquo; she sobbed, &lsquo;that I was unhappy at 
home&mdash;and&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t like him so well as I did
at first&mdash;and I wished I could get out of the mess I was 
in!&nbsp; And then I saw you a few times, and when you said, 
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll run off,&rdquo; I thought I saw a way out of 
it all, and then I agreed to come with 
you&mdash;oo-oo!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well! well! well!&nbsp; And is this true?&rsquo; 
murmured the bewildered old nobleman, staring from James to 
Laura, and from Laura to James, as if he fancied they might be 
figments of the imagination.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is this, then, James, 
the secret of your kindness to your old uncle in helping him to 
find his daughter?&nbsp; Good Heavens!&nbsp; What further depths 
of duplicity are there left for a man to learn!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have married her, Uncle Quantock, as I said,&rsquo; 
answered James coolly.&nbsp; &lsquo;The deed is done, and 
can&rsquo;t be undone by talking here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where were you married?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At St. Mary&rsquo;s, Toneborough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the 29th of September, during the time she was 
visiting there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who married you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; One of the curates&mdash;we 
were quite strangers to the place.&nbsp; So, instead of my 
assisting you to recover her, you may as well assist 
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never! never!&rsquo; said Lord Quantock.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Madam, and sir, I beg to tell you that I wash my hands of 
the whole affair!&nbsp; If you are man and wife, as it seems you 
are, get reconciled as best you may.&nbsp; I have no more to say 
or do with either of you.&nbsp; I leave you, Laura, in the hands 
of your husband, and much joy may you bring him; though the 
situation, I own, is not encouraging.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Saying this, the indignant speaker pushed back his chair 
against the table with such force that the candlesticks rocked on
their bases, and left the room.</p>
<p>Laura&rsquo;s wet eyes roved from one of the young men to the 
other, who now stood glaring face to face, and, being much 
frightened at their aspect, slipped out of the room after her 
father.&nbsp; Him, however, she could hear going out of the front
door, and, not knowing where to take shelter, she crept into the 
darkness of an adjoining bedroom, and there awaited events with a
palpitating heart.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the two men remaining in the sitting-room drew 
nearer to each other, and the opera-singer broke the silence by 
saying, &lsquo;How could you insult me in the way you did, 
calling me a fellow, and accusing me of poisoning her mind toward
you, when you knew very well I was as ignorant of your relation 
to her as an unborn babe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, you were quite ignorant; I can believe that 
readily,&rsquo; sneered Laura&rsquo;s husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I here call Heaven to witness that I never 
knew!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Recitativo&mdash;the rhythm excellent, and the tone 
well sustained.&nbsp; Is it likely that any man could win the 
confidence of a young fool her age, and not get that out of 
her?&nbsp; Preposterous!&nbsp; Tell it to the most improved new 
pit-stalls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Captain Northbrook, your insinuations are as despicable
as your wretched person!&rsquo; cried the baritone, losing all 
patience.&nbsp; And springing forward he slapped the captain in 
the face with the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>Northbrook flinched but slightly, and calmly using his 
handkerchief to learn if his nose was bleeding, said, &lsquo;I 
quite expected this insult, so I came prepared.&rsquo;&nbsp; And 
he drew forth from a black valise which he carried in his hand a 
small case of pistols.</p>
<p>The baritone started at the unexpected sight, but recovering 
from his surprise said, &lsquo;Very well, as you will,&rsquo; 
though perhaps his tone showed a slight want of confidence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; continued the husband, quite confidingly, 
&lsquo;we want no parade, no nonsense, you know.&nbsp; Therefore 
we&rsquo;ll dispense with seconds?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The signor slightly nodded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know this part of the country well?&rsquo; 
Cousin James went on, in the same cool and still manner.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t, I do.&nbsp; Quite at the bottom of the
rocks out there, just beyond the stream which falls over them to 
the shore, is a smooth sandy space, not so much shut in as to be 
out of the moonlight; and the way down to it from this side is 
over steps cut in the cliff; and we can find our way down without
trouble.&nbsp; We&mdash;we two&mdash;will find our way down; but 
only one of us will find his way up, you understand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then suppose we start; the sooner it is over the 
better.&nbsp; We can order supper before we go out&mdash;supper 
for two; for though we are three at present&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Three?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; you and I and she&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&mdash;We shall be only two by and by; so that, as I 
say, we will order supper for two; for the lady and a 
gentleman.&nbsp; Whichever comes back alive will tap at her door,
and call her in to share the repast with him&mdash;she&rsquo;s 
not off the premises.&nbsp; But we must not alarm her now; and 
above all things we must not let the inn-people see us go out; it
would look so odd for two to go out, and only one come in.&nbsp; 
Ha! ha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha! ha! exactly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you ready?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh&mdash;quite.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll lead the way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went softly to the door and downstairs, ordering supper to 
be ready in an hour, as he had said; then making a feint of 
returning to the room again, he beckoned to the singer, and 
together they slipped out of the house by a side door.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The sky was now quite clear, and the wheelmarks of the 
brougham which had borne away Laura&rsquo;s father, Lord 
Quantock, remained distinctly visible.&nbsp; Soon the verge of 
the down was reached, the captain leading the way, and the 
baritone following silently, casting furtive glances at his 
companion, and beyond him at the scene ahead.&nbsp; In due course
they arrived at the chasm in the cliff which formed the 
waterfall.&nbsp; The outlook here was wild and picturesque in the
extreme, and fully justified the many praises, paintings, and 
photographic views to which the spot had given birth.&nbsp; What 
in summer was charmingly green and gray, was now rendered weird 
and fantastic by the snow.</p>
<p>From their feet the cascade plunged downward almost vertically
to a depth of eighty or a hundred feet before finally losing 
itself in the sand, and though the stream was but small, its 
impact upon jutting rocks in its descent divided it into a 
hundred spirts and splashes that sent up a mist into the upper 
air.&nbsp; A few marginal drippings had been frozen into icicles,
but the centre flowed on unimpeded.</p>
<p>The operatic artist looked down as he halted, but his thoughts
were plainly not of the beauty of the scene.&nbsp; His companion 
with the pistols was immediately in front of him, and there was 
no handrail on the side of the path toward the chasm.&nbsp; 
Obeying a quick impulse, he stretched out his arm, and with a 
superhuman thrust sent Laura&rsquo;s husband reeling over.&nbsp; 
A whirling human shape, diminishing downward in the moon&rsquo;s 
rays farther and farther toward invisibility, a smack-smack upon 
the projecting ledges of rock&mdash;at first louder and heavier 
than that of the brook, and then scarcely to be distinguished 
from it&mdash;then a cessation, then the splashing of the stream 
as before, and the accompanying murmur of the sea, were all the 
incidents that disturbed the customary flow of the little 
waterfall.</p>
<p>The singer waited in a fixed attitude for a few minutes, then 
turning, he rapidly retraced his steps over the intervening 
upland toward the road, and in less than a quarter of an hour was
at the door of the hotel.&nbsp; Slipping quietly in as the clock 
struck ten, he said to the landlord, over the bar 
hatchway&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The bill as soon as you can let me have it, including 
charges for the supper that was ordered, though we cannot stay to
eat it, I am sorry to say.&rsquo;&nbsp; He added with forced 
gaiety, &lsquo;The lady&rsquo;s father and cousin have thought 
better of intercepting the marriage, and after quarrelling with 
each other have gone home independently.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well done, sir!&rsquo; said the landlord, who still 
sided with this customer in preference to those who had given 
trouble and barely paid for baiting the horses.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;&ldquo;Love will find out the way!&rdquo; as the saying 
is.&nbsp; Wish you joy, sir!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Signor Smithozzi went upstairs, and on entering the 
sitting-room found that Laura had crept out from the dark 
adjoining chamber in his absence.&nbsp; She looked up at him with
eyes red from weeping, and with symptoms of alarm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&mdash;where is he?&rsquo; she said 
apprehensively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Captain Northbrook has gone back.&nbsp; He says he will
have no more to do with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I am quite abandoned by them!&mdash;and 
they&rsquo;ll forget me, and nobody care about me any 
more!&rsquo;&nbsp; She began to cry afresh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is the luckiest thing that could have 
happened.&nbsp; All is just as it was before they came disturbing
us.&nbsp; But, Laura, you ought to have told me about that 
private marriage, though it is all the same now; it will be 
dissolved, of course.&nbsp; You are a wid&mdash;virtually a 
widow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is no use to reproach me for what is past.&nbsp; 
What am I to do now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We go at once to Cliff-Martin.&nbsp; The horse has 
rested thoroughly these last three hours, and he will have no 
difficulty in doing an additional half-dozen miles.&nbsp; We 
shall be there before twelve, and there are late taverns in the 
place, no doubt.&nbsp; There we&rsquo;ll sell both horse and 
carriage to-morrow morning; and go by the coach to 
Downstaple.&nbsp; Once in the train we are safe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I agree to anything,&rsquo; she said listlessly.</p>
<p>In about ten minutes the horse was put in, the bill paid, the 
lady&rsquo;s dried wraps put round her, and the journey 
resumed.</p>
<p>When about a mile on their way, they saw a glimmering light in
advance of them.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wonder what that is?&rsquo; said 
the baritone, whose manner had latterly become nervous, every 
sound and sight causing him to turn his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is only a turnpike,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;That light is the lamp kept burning over the 
door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, of course, dearest.&nbsp; How stupid I 
am!&rsquo;</p>
<p>On reaching the gate they perceived that a man on foot had 
approached it, apparently by some more direct path than the 
roadway they pursued, and was, at the moment they drew up, 
standing in conversation with the gatekeeper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is quite impossible that he could fall over the 
cliff by accident or the will of God on such a light night as 
this,&rsquo; the pedestrian was saying.&nbsp; &lsquo;These two 
children I tell you of saw two men go along the path toward the 
waterfall, and ten minutes later only one of &rsquo;em came back,
walking fast, like a man who wanted to get out of the way because
he had done something queer.&nbsp; There is no manner of doubt 
that he pushed the other man over, and, mark me, it will soon 
cause a hue and cry for that man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The candle shone in the face of the Signor and showed that 
there had arisen upon it a film of ghastliness.&nbsp; Laura, 
glancing toward him for a few moments observed it, till, the 
gatekeeper having mechanically swung open the gate, her companion
drove through, and they were soon again enveloped in the white 
silence.</p>
<p>Her conductor had said to Laura, just before, that he meant to
inquire the way at this turnpike; but he had certainly not done 
so.</p>
<p>As soon as they had gone a little farther the omission, 
intentional or not, began to cause them some trouble.&nbsp; 
Beyond the secluded district which they now traversed ran the 
more frequented road, where progress would be easy, the snow 
being probably already beaten there to some extent by traffic; 
but they had not yet reached it, and having no one to guide them 
their journey began to appear less feasible than it had done 
before starting.&nbsp; When the little lane which they had 
entered ascended another hill, and seemed to wind round in a 
direction contrary to the expected route to Cliff-Martin, the 
question grew serious.&nbsp; Ever since overhearing the 
conversation at the turnpike, Laura had maintained a perfect 
silence, and had even shrunk somewhat away from the side of her 
lover.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you talk, Laura,&rsquo; he said with 
forced buoyancy, &lsquo;and suggest the way we should 
go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, I will,&rsquo; she responded, a curious 
fearfulness being audible in her voice.</p>
<p>After this she uttered a few occasional sentences which seemed
to persuade him that she suspected nothing.&nbsp; At last he drew
rein, and the weary horse stood still.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are in a fix,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>She answered eagerly: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll hold the reins while 
you run forward to the top of the ridge, and see if the road 
takes a favourable turn beyond.&nbsp; It would give the horse a 
few minutes&rsquo; rest, and if you find out no change in the 
direction, we will retrace this lane, and take the other 
turning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The expedient seemed a good one in the circumstances, 
especially when recommended by the singular eagerness of her 
voice; and placing the reins in her hands&mdash;a quite 
unnecessary precaution, considering the state of their 
hack&mdash;he stepped out and went forward through the snow till 
she could see no more of him.</p>
<p>No sooner was he gone than Laura, with a rapidity which 
contrasted strangely with her previous stillness, made fast the 
reins to the corner of the phaeton, and slipping out on the 
opposite side, ran back with all her might down the hill, till, 
coming to an opening in the fence, she scrambled through it, and 
plunged into the copse which bordered this portion of the 
lane.&nbsp; Here she stood in hiding under one of the large 
bushes, clinging so closely to its umbrage as to seem but a 
portion of its mass, and listening intently for the faintest 
sound of pursuit.&nbsp; But nothing disturbed the stillness save 
the occasional slipping of gathered snow from the boughs, or the 
rustle of some wild animal over the crisp flake-bespattered 
herbage.&nbsp; At length, apparently convinced that her former 
companion was either unable to find her, or not anxious to do so,
in the present strange state of affairs, she crept out from the 
bushes, and in less than an hour found herself again approaching 
the door of the Prospect Hotel.</p>
<p>As she drew near, Laura could see that, far from being wrapped
in darkness, as she might have expected, there were ample signs 
that all the tenants were on the alert, lights moving about the 
open space in front.&nbsp; Satisfaction was expressed in her face
when she discerned that no reappearance of her baritone and his 
pony-carriage was causing this sensation; but it speedily gave 
way to grief and dismay when she saw by the lights the form of a 
man borne on a stretcher by two others into the porch of the 
hotel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have caused all this,&rsquo; she murmured between her
quivering lips.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has murdered him!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Running forward to the door, she hastily asked of the first 
person she met if the man on the stretcher was dead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, miss,&rsquo; said the labourer addressed, eyeing 
her up and down as an unexpected apparition.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is 
still alive, they say, but not sensible.&nbsp; He either fell or 
was pushed over the waterfall; &rsquo;tis thoughted he was 
pushed.&nbsp; He is the gentleman who came here just now with the
old lord, and went out afterward (as is thoughted) with a 
stranger who had come a little earlier.&nbsp; Anyhow, 
that&rsquo;s as I had it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Laura entered the house, and acknowledging without the least 
reserve that she was the injured man&rsquo;s wife, had soon 
installed herself as head nurse by the bed on which he lay.&nbsp;
When the two surgeons who had been sent for arrived, she learned 
from them that his wounds were so severe as to leave but a 
slender hope of recovery, it being little short of miraculous 
that he was not killed on the spot, which his enemy had evidently
reckoned to be the case.&nbsp; She knew who that enemy was, and 
shuddered.</p>
<p>Laura watched all night, but her husband knew nothing of her 
presence.&nbsp; During the next day he slightly recognized her, 
and in the evening was able to speak.&nbsp; He informed the 
surgeons that, as was surmised, he had been pushed over the 
cascade by Signor Smithozzi; but he communicated nothing to her 
who nursed him, not even replying to her remarks; he nodded 
courteously at any act of attention she rendered, and that was 
all.</p>
<p>In a day or two it was declared that everything favoured his 
recovery, notwithstanding the severity of his injuries.&nbsp; 
Full search was made for Smithozzi, but as yet there was no 
intelligence of his whereabouts, though the repentant Laura 
communicated all she knew.&nbsp; As far as could be judged, he 
had come back to the carriage after searching out the way, and 
finding the young lady missing, had looked about for her till he 
was tired; then had driven on to Cliff-Martin, sold the horse and
carriage next morning, and disappeared, probably by one of the 
departing coaches which ran thence to the nearest station, the 
only difference from his original programme being that he had 
gone alone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>During the days and weeks of that long and tedious recovery, 
Laura watched by her husband&rsquo;s bedside with a zeal and 
assiduity which would have considerably extenuated any fault save
one of such magnitude as hers.&nbsp; That her husband did not 
forgive her was soon obvious.&nbsp; Nothing that she could do in 
the way of smoothing pillows, easing his position, shifting 
bandages, or administering draughts, could win from him more than
a few measured words of thankfulness, such as he would probably 
have uttered to any other woman on earth who had performed these 
particular services for him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear, dear James,&rsquo; she said one day, bending her 
face upon the bed in an excess of emotion.&nbsp; &lsquo;How you 
have suffered!&nbsp; It has been too cruel.&nbsp; I am more glad 
you are getting better than I can say.&nbsp; I have prayed for 
it&mdash;and I am sorry for what I have done; I am innocent of 
the worst, and&mdash;I hope you will not think me so very bad, 
James!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no.&nbsp; On the contrary, I shall think you very 
good&mdash;as a nurse,&rsquo; he answered, the caustic severity 
of his tone being apparent through its weakness.</p>
<p>Laura let fall two or three silent tears, and said no more 
that day.</p>
<p>Somehow or other Signor Smithozzi seemed to be making good his
escape.&nbsp; It transpired that he had not taken a passage in 
either of the suspected coaches, though he had certainly got out 
of the county; altogether, the chance of finding him was 
problematical.</p>
<p>Not only did Captain Northbrook survive his injuries, but it 
soon appeared that in the course of a few weeks he would find 
himself little if any the worse for the catastrophe.&nbsp; It 
could also be seen that Laura, while secretly hoping for her 
husband&rsquo;s forgiveness for a piece of folly of which she saw
the enormity more clearly every day, was in great doubt as to 
what her future relations with him would be.&nbsp; Moreover, to 
add to the complication, whilst she, as a runaway wife, was 
unforgiven by her husband, she and her husband, as a runaway 
couple, were unforgiven by her father, who had never once 
communicated with either of them since his departure from the 
inn.&nbsp; But her immediate anxiety was to win the pardon of her
husband, who possibly might be bearing in mind, as he lay upon 
his couch, the familiar words of Brabantio, &lsquo;She has 
deceived her father, and may thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Matters went on thus till Captain Northbrook was able to walk 
about.&nbsp; He then removed with his wife to quiet apartments on
the south coast, and here his recovery was rapid.&nbsp; Walking 
up the cliffs one day, supporting him by her arm as usual, she 
said to him, simply, &lsquo;James, if I go on as I am going now, 
and always attend to your smallest want, and never think of 
anything but devotion to you, will you&mdash;try to like me a 
little?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a thing I must carefully consider,&rsquo; he 
said, with the same gloomy dryness which characterized all his 
words to her now.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I have considered, I will 
tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did not tell her that evening, though she lingered long at 
her routine work of making his bedroom comfortable, putting the 
light so that it would not shine into his eyes, seeing him fall 
asleep, and then retiring noiselessly to her own chamber.&nbsp; 
When they met in the morning at breakfast, and she had asked him 
as usual how he had passed the night, she added timidly, in the 
silence which followed his reply, &lsquo;Have you 
considered?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I have not considered sufficiently to give you an 
answer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Laura sighed, but to no purpose; and the day wore on with 
intense heaviness to her, and the customary modicum of strength 
gained to him.</p>
<p>The next morning she put the same question, and looked up 
despairingly in his face, as though her whole life hung upon his 
reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I have considered,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must part.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O James!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot forgive you; no man would.&nbsp; Enough is 
settled upon you to keep you in comfort, whatever your father may
do.&nbsp; I shall sell out, and disappear from this 
hemisphere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have absolutely decided?&rsquo; she asked 
miserably.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have nobody now to c-c-care 
for&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have absolutely decided,&rsquo; he shortly 
returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;We had better part here.&nbsp; You will go
back to your father.&nbsp; There is no reason why I should 
accompany you, since my presence would only stand in the way of 
the forgiveness he will probably grant you if you appear before 
him alone.&nbsp; We will say farewell to each other in three days
from this time.&nbsp; I have calculated on being ready to go on 
that day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bowed down with trouble, she withdrew to her room, and the 
three days were passed by her husband in writing letters and 
attending to other business-matters, saying hardly a word to her 
the while.&nbsp; The morning of departure came; but before the 
horses had been put in to take the severed twain in different 
directions, out of sight of each other, possibly for ever, the 
postman arrived with the morning letters.</p>
<p>There was one for the captain; none for her&mdash;there were 
never any for her.&nbsp; However, on this occasion something was 
enclosed for her in his, which he handed her.&nbsp; She read it 
and looked up helpless.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear father&mdash;is dead!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; In
a few moments she added, in a whisper, &lsquo;I must go to the 
Manor to bury him . . . Will you go with me, James?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He musingly looked out of the window.&nbsp; &lsquo;I suppose 
it is an awkward and melancholy undertaking for a woman 
alone,&rsquo; he said coldly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, well&mdash;my 
poor uncle!&mdash;Yes, I&rsquo;ll go with you, and see you 
through the business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they went off together instead of asunder, as 
planned.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to record the details of the 
journey, or of the sad week which followed it at her 
father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Lord Quantock&rsquo;s seat was a fine
old mansion standing in its own park, and there were plenty of 
opportunities for husband and wife either to avoid each other, or
to get reconciled if they were so minded, which one of them was 
at least.&nbsp; Captain Northbrook was not present at the reading
of the will.&nbsp; She came to him afterward, and found him 
packing up his papers, intending to start next morning, now that 
he had seen her through the turmoil occasioned by her 
father&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has left me everything that he could!&rsquo; she 
said to her husband.&nbsp; &lsquo;James, will you forgive me now,
and stay?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot stay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot stay,&rsquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He acted up to his word.&nbsp; When she came downstairs the 
next morning she was told that he had gone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Laura bore her double bereavement as best she could.&nbsp; The
vast mansion in which she had hitherto lived, with all its 
historic contents, had gone to her father&rsquo;s successor in 
the title; but her own was no unhandsome one.&nbsp; Around lay 
the undulating park, studded with trees a dozen times her own 
age; beyond it, the wood; beyond the wood, the farms.&nbsp; All 
this fair and quiet scene was hers.&nbsp; She nevertheless 
remained a lonely, repentant, depressed being, who would have 
given the greater part of everything she possessed to ensure the 
presence and affection of that husband whose very austerity and 
phlegm&mdash;qualities that had formerly led to the alienation 
between them&mdash;seemed now to be adorable features in his 
character.</p>
<p>She hoped and hoped again, but all to no purpose.&nbsp; 
Captain Northbrook did not alter his mind and return.&nbsp; He 
was quite a different sort of man from one who altered his mind; 
that she was at last despairingly forced to admit.&nbsp; And then
she left off hoping, and settled down to a mechanical routine of 
existence which in some measure dulled her grief; but at the 
expense of all her natural animation and the sprightly wilfulness
which had once charmed those who knew her, though it was perhaps 
all the while a factor in the production of her unhappiness.</p>
<p>To say that her beauty quite departed as the years rolled on 
would be to overstate the truth.&nbsp; Time is not a merciful 
master, as we all know, and he was not likely to act 
exceptionally in the case of a woman who had mental troubles to 
bear in addition to the ordinary weight of years.&nbsp; Be this 
as it may, eleven other winters came and went, and Laura 
Northbrook remained the lonely mistress of house and lands 
without once hearing of her husband.&nbsp; Every probability 
seemed to favour the assumption that he had died in some foreign 
land; and offers for her hand were not few as the probability 
verged on certainty with the long lapse of time.&nbsp; But the 
idea of remarriage seemed never to have entered her head for a 
moment.&nbsp; Whether she continued to hope even now for his 
return could not be distinctly ascertained; at all events she 
lived a life unmodified in the slightest degree from that of the 
first six months of his absence.</p>
<p>This twelfth year of Laura&rsquo;s loneliness, and the 
thirtieth of her life drew on apace, and the season approached 
that had seen the unhappy adventure for which she so long had 
suffered.&nbsp; Christmas promised to be rather wet than cold, 
and the trees on the outskirts of Laura&rsquo;s estate dripped 
monotonously from day to day upon the turnpike-road which 
bordered them.&nbsp; On an afternoon in this week between three 
and four o&rsquo;clock a hired fly might have been seen driving 
along the highway at this point, and on reaching the top of the 
hill it stopped.&nbsp; A gentleman of middle age alighted from 
the vehicle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You need drive no farther,&rsquo; he said to the 
coachman.&nbsp; &lsquo;The rain seems to have nearly 
ceased.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stroll a little way, and return on foot 
to the inn by dinner-time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The flyman touched his hat, turned the horse, and drove back 
as directed.&nbsp; When he was out of sight, the gentleman walked
on, but he had not gone far before the rain again came down 
pitilessly, though of this the pedestrian took little heed, going
leisurely onward till he reached Laura&rsquo;s park gate, which 
he passed through.&nbsp; The clouds were thick and the days were 
short, so that by the time he stood in front of the mansion it 
was dark.&nbsp; In addition to this his appearance, which on 
alighting from the carriage had been untarnished, partook now of 
the character of a drenched wayfarer not too well blessed with 
this world&rsquo;s goods.&nbsp; He halted for no more than a 
moment at the front entrance, and going round to the 
servants&rsquo; quarter, as if he had a preconceived purpose in 
so doing, there rang the bell.&nbsp; When a page came to him he 
inquired if they would kindly allow him to dry himself by the 
kitchen fire.</p>
<p>The page retired, and after a murmured colloquy returned with 
the cook, who informed the wet and muddy man that though it was 
not her custom to admit strangers, she should have no particular 
objection to his drying himself; the night being so damp and 
gloomy.&nbsp; Therefore the wayfarer entered and sat down by the 
fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The owner of this house is a very rich gentleman, no 
doubt?&rsquo; he asked, as he watched the meat turning on the 
spit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis not a gentleman, but a lady,&rsquo; said the
cook.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A widow, I presume?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A sort of widow.&nbsp; Poor soul, her husband is gone 
abroad, and has never been heard of for many years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She sees plenty of company, no doubt, to make up for 
his absence?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed&mdash;hardly a soul.&nbsp; Service here is 
as bad as being in a nunnery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In short, the wayfarer, who had at first been so coldly 
received, contrived by his frank and engaging manner to draw the 
ladies of the kitchen into a most confidential conversation, in 
which Laura&rsquo;s history was minutely detailed, from the day 
of her husband&rsquo;s departure to the present.&nbsp; The 
salient feature in all their discourse was her unflagging 
devotion to his memory.</p>
<p>Having apparently learned all that he wanted to 
know&mdash;among other things that she was at this moment, as 
always, alone&mdash;the traveller said he was quite dry; and 
thanking the servants for their kindness, departed as he had 
come.&nbsp; On emerging into the darkness he did not, however, go
down the avenue by which he had arrived.&nbsp; He simply walked 
round to the front door.&nbsp; There he rang, and the door was 
opened to him by a man-servant whom he had not seen during his 
sojourn at the other end of the house.</p>
<p>In answer to the servant&rsquo;s inquiry for his name, he said
ceremoniously, &lsquo;Will you tell The Honourable Mrs. 
Northbrook that the man she nursed many years ago, after a 
frightful accident, has called to thank her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The footman retreated, and it was rather a long time before 
any further signs of attention were apparent.&nbsp; Then he was 
shown into the drawing-room, and the door closed behind him.</p>
<p>On the couch was Laura, trembling and pale.&nbsp; She parted 
her lips and held out her hands to him, but could not 
speak.&nbsp; But he did not require speech, and in a moment they 
were in each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>Strange news circulated through that mansion and the 
neighbouring town on the next and following days.&nbsp; But the 
world has a way of getting used to things, and the intelligence 
of the return of The Honourable Mrs. Northbrook&rsquo;s 
long-absent husband was soon received with comparative calm.</p>
<p>A few days more brought Christmas, and the forlorn home of 
Laura Northbrook blazed from basement to attic with light and 
cheerfulness.&nbsp; Not that the house was overcrowded with 
visitors, but many were present, and the apathy of a dozen years 
came at length to an end.&nbsp; The animation which set in thus 
at the close of the old year did not diminish on the arrival of 
the new; and by the time its twelve months had likewise run the 
course of its predecessors, a son had been added to the dwindled 
line of the Northbrook family.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>At the conclusion of this narrative the Spark was thanked, 
with a manner of some surprise, for nobody had credited him with 
a taste for tale-telling.&nbsp; Though it had been resolved that 
this story should be the last, a few of the weather-bound 
listeners were for sitting on into the small hours over their 
pipes and glasses, and raking up yet more episodes of family 
history.&nbsp; But the majority murmured reasons for soon getting
to their lodgings.</p>
<p>It was quite dark without, except in the immediate 
neighbourhood of the feeble street-lamps, and before a few 
shop-windows which had been hardily kept open in spite of the 
obvious unlikelihood of any chance customer traversing the muddy 
thoroughfares at that hour.</p>
<p>By one, by two, and by three the benighted members of the 
Field-Club rose from their seats, shook hands, made appointments,
and dropped away to their respective quarters, free or hired, 
hoping for a fair morrow.&nbsp; It would probably be not until 
the next summer meeting, months away in the future, that the easy
intercourse which now existed between them all would repeat 
itself.&nbsp; The crimson maltster, for instance, knew that on 
the following market-day his friends the President, the Rural 
Dean, and the bookworm would pass him in the street, if they met 
him, with the barest nod of civility, the President and the 
Colonel for social reasons, the bookworm for intellectual 
reasons, and the Rural Dean for moral ones, the latter being a 
staunch teetotaller, dead against John Barleycorn.&nbsp; The 
sentimental member knew that when, on his rambles, he met his 
friend the bookworm with a pocket-copy of something or other 
under his nose, the latter would not love his companionship as he
had done to-day; and the President, the aristocrat, and the 
farmer knew that affairs political, sporting, domestic, or 
agricultural would exclude for a long time all rumination on the 
characters of dames gone to dust for scores of years, however 
beautiful and noble they may have been in their day.</p>
<p>The last member at length departed, the attendant at the 
museum lowered the fire, the curator locked up the rooms, and 
soon there was only a single pirouetting flame on the top of a 
single coal to make the bones of the ichthyosaurus seem to leap, 
the stuffed birds to wink, and to draw a smile from the varnished
skulls of Vespasian&rsquo;s soldiery.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
